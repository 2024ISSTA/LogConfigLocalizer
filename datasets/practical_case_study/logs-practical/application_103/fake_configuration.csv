1,dfs.datanode.metrics.logger.period.seconds,600,"This setting controls how frequently the DataNode logs its metrics. The
    logging configuration must also define one or more appenders for
    DataNodeMetricsLog for the metrics to be logged.
    DataNode metrics logging is disabled if this value is set to zero or
    less than zero."
2,hadoop.security.kms.client.encrypted.key.cache.size,500,Size of the EncryptedKeyVersion cache Queue for each key
3,dfs.datanode.socket.reuse.keepalive,4000,"The window of time in ms before the DataXceiver closes a socket for a
    single request.  If a second request occurs within that window, the
    socket can be reused."
4,dfs.namenode.num.checkpoints.retained,2,"The number of image checkpoint files (fsimage_*) that will be retained by
  the NameNode and Secondary NameNode in their storage directories. All edit
  logs (stored on edits_* files) necessary to recover an up-to-date namespace from the oldest retained
  checkpoint will also be retained."
5,dfs.storage.policy.satisfier.datanode.cache.refresh.interval.ms,300000,"How often to refresh the datanode storages cache in milliseconds. This cache
    keeps live datanode storage reports fetched from namenode. After elapsed time,
    it will again fetch latest datanodes from namenode.
    By default, this parameter is set to 5 minutes."
6,dfs.batched.ls.limit,100,"Limit the number of paths that can be listed in a single batched
    listing call. printed by ls. If less or equal to
    zero, at most DFS_LIST_LIMIT_DEFAULT (= 1000) will be printed."
7,seq.io.sort.mb,100,"The total amount of buffer memory to use while sorting files,
      while using SequenceFile.Sorter, in megabytes. By default,
      gives each merge stream 1MB, which should minimize seeks."
8,fs.s3a.multipart.purge.age,86400,"Minimum age in seconds of multipart uploads to purge
    on startup if ""fs.s3a.multipart.purge"" is true"
9,dfs.datanode.available-space-volume-choosing-policy.balanced-space-threshold,10737418240,"Only used when the dfs.datanode.fsdataset.volume.choosing.policy is set to
    org.apache.hadoop.hdfs.server.datanode.fsdataset.AvailableSpaceVolumeChoosingPolicy.
    This setting controls how much DN volumes are allowed to differ in terms of
    bytes of free disk space before they are considered imbalanced. If the free
    space of all the volumes are within this range of each other, the volumes
    will be considered balanced and block assignments will be done on a pure
    round robin basis. Support multiple size unit suffix(case insensitive), as
    described in dfs.blocksize."
