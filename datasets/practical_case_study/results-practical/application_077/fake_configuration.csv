1,dfs.datanode.du.reserved.pct,0,"Reserved space in percentage. Read dfs.datanode.du.reserved.calculator to see
    when this takes effect. The actual number of bytes reserved will be calculated by using the
    total capacity of the data directory in question. Specific storage type based reservation
    is also supported. The property can be followed with corresponding storage types
    ([ssd]/[disk]/[archive]/[ram_disk]) for cluster with heterogeneous storage.
    For example, reserved percentage space for RAM_DISK storage can be configured using property
    'dfs.datanode.du.reserved.pct.ram_disk'. If specific storage type reservation is not configured
    then dfs.datanode.du.reserved.pct will be used."

    journals."
3,dfs.namenode.path.based.cache.retry.interval.ms,30000,"When the NameNode needs to uncache something that is cached, or cache
    something that is not cached, it must direct the DataNodes to do so by
    sending a DNA_CACHE or DNA_UNCACHE command in response to a DataNode
    heartbeat.  This parameter controls how frequently the NameNode will
    resend these commands."

  terminated if it stays in finishing state for too long.
  After a task attempt completes from TaskUmbilicalProtocol's point of view,
  it will be transitioned to finishing state. That will give a chance for the
  task to exit by itself."

    MR AppMaster from remote tasks"
9,mapreduce.client.progressmonitor.pollinterval,1000,"The interval (in milliseconds) between which the JobClient
    reports status to the console and checks for job completion. You may want to set this
    to a lower value to make tests run faster on a single node system. Adjusting
    this value in production may lead to unwanted client-server traffic."
