0,io.file.buffer.size,2112001717,"The size of buffer for use in sequence files.
  The size of this buffer should probably be a multiple of hardware
  page size (4096 on Intel x86), and it determines how much data is
  buffered during read and write operations."

3,mapreduce.input.fileinputformat.list-status.num-threads,1,"The number of threads to use to list and fetch block locations
  for the specified input paths. Note: multiple threads should not be used
  if a custom non thread-safe path filter is used."
4,dfs.datanode.scan.period.hours,504,"If this is positive, the DataNode will not scan any
        individual block more than once in the specified scan period.
        If this is negative, the block scanner is disabled.
        If this is set to zero, then the default value of 504 hours
        or 3 weeks is used. Prior versions of HDFS incorrectly documented
        that setting this key to zero will disable the block scanner."

    information about. This property applies to DecayRpcScheduler."
6,dfs.datanode.cached-dfsused.check.interval.ms,600000,"The interval check time of loading DU_CACHE_FILE in each volume.
    When the cluster doing the rolling upgrade operations, it will
    usually lead dfsUsed cache file of each volume expired and redo the
    du operations in datanode and that makes datanode start slowly. Adjust
    this property can make cache file be available for the time as you want."

    the delay time will increase exponentially(double) for each retry
    until dfs.client.block.write.locateFollowingBlock.max.delay.ms is reached,
    after that the delay for each retry will be
