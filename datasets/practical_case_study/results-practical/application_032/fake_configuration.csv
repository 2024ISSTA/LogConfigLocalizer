1,dfs.datanode.socket.reuse.keepalive,4000,"The window of time in ms before the DataXceiver closes a socket for a
    single request.  If a second request occurs within that window, the
    socket can be reused."
2,mapreduce.task.userlog.limit.kb,0,The maximum size of user-logs of each task in KB. 0 disables the cap.
3,mapreduce.job.local-fs.single-disk-limit.check.interval-ms,5000,Interval of disk limit check to run in ms.
4,dfs.namenode.file.close.num-committed-allowed,0,"Normally a file can only be closed with all its blocks are committed.
    When this value is set to a positive integer N, a file can be closed
    when N blocks are committed and the rest complete."
5,ipc.client.connect.max.retries.on.timeouts,45,"Indicates the number of retries a client will make on socket timeout

8,mapreduce.jobhistory.loadedjobs.cache.size,5,"Size of the loaded job cache.  This property is ignored if
  the property mapreduce.jobhistory.loadedtasks.cache.size is set to a

9,fs.s3a.executor.capacity,16,"The maximum number of submitted tasks which is a single
    operation (e.g. rename(), delete()) may submit simultaneously for
    execution -excluding the IO-heavy block uploads, whose capacity
    is set in ""fs.s3a.fast.upload.active.blocks""

    All tasks are submitted to the shared thread pool whose size is
    set in ""fs.s3a.threads.max""; the value of capacity should be less than that
    of the thread pool itself, as the goal is to stop a single operation
    from overloading that thread pool."
