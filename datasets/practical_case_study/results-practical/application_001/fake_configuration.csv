    when this takes effect. The actual number of bytes reserved will be calculated by using the
    total capacity of the data directory in question. Specific storage type based reservation
    is also supported. The property can be followed with corresponding storage types
    ([ssd]/[disk]/[archive]/[ram_disk]) for cluster with heterogeneous storage.
    For example, reserved percentage space for RAM_DISK storage can be configured using property
    'dfs.datanode.du.reserved.pct.ram_disk'. If specific storage type reservation is not configured
    then dfs.datanode.du.reserved.pct will be used."
