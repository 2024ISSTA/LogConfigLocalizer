name:mapreduce.framework.name
value:yarn
relevant log:1-INFO ipc.Client: Retrying connect to server: localhost/127.0.0.1:8032. Already tried 0 time(s); retry policy is RetryUpToMaximumCountWithFixedSleep(maxRetries=10, sleepTime=1000 MILLISECONDS)
explanation: The log indicates that the system is trying to connect to the server but is unable to do so. The mapreduce.framework.name configuration is set to 'yarn', which means the system is using YARN (Yet Another Resource Negotiator) for resource management. If the YARN server is not running or not reachable, it could cause this connection issue.

name:dfs.client.socketcache.capacity
value:16
relevant log:1-INFO ipc.Client: Retrying connect to server: localhost/127.0.0.1:8032. Already tried 0 time(s); retry policy is RetryUpToMaximumCountWithFixedSleep(maxRetries=10, sleepTime=1000 MILLISECONDS)
explanation: The dfs.client.socketcache.capacity configuration is related to the socket cache capacity for short-circuit reads. If the value is set too low, it might cause connection issues as indicated in the log.

name:dfs.balancer.service.retries.on.exception
value:5
relevant log:1-INFO ipc.Client: Retrying connect to server: localhost/127.0.0.1:8032. Already tried 0 time(s); retry policy is RetryUpToMaximumCountWithFixedSleep(maxRetries=10, sleepTime=1000 MILLISECONDS)
explanation: The dfs.balancer.service.retries.on.exception configuration determines how many times the balancer service will retry upon encountering an exception before considering the exception to be fatal and quitting. The log indicates that the system is retrying to connect to the server, which might be related to this configuration.
