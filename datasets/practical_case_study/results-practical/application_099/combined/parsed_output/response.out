name:yarn.resourcemanager.hostname
value:<missing>
relevant log:2-1-INFO       org.apache.hadoop.service.AbstractService: Service NodeManager failed in state STARTED; cause: org.apache.hadoop.yarn.exceptions.YarnRuntimeException: java.net.ConnectException: Call From ec2-52-88-167-9.us-west-2.compute.amazonaws.com/172.31.29.154 to 0.0.0.0:8031 failed on connection exception: java.net.ConnectException: Connection refused; For more details see:  http://wiki.apache.org/hadoop/ConnectionRefused
explanation:The Yarn NodeManager service failed to start due to a connection exception. The hostname for the Yarn ResourceManager is missing, which could be the root cause of this connection issue.

name:dfs.client.socket.send.buffer.size
value:0
relevant log:2-1-INFO       org.apache.hadoop.service.AbstractService: Service NodeManager failed in state STARTED; cause: org.apache.hadoop.yarn.exceptions.YarnRuntimeException: java.net.ConnectException: Call From ec2-52-88-167-9.us-west-2.compute.amazonaws.com/172.31.29.154 to 0.0.0.0:8031 failed on connection exception: java.net.ConnectException: Connection refused; For more details see:  http://wiki.apache.org/hadoop/ConnectionRefused
explanation:The socket send buffer size for the DFSClient is set to 0, which means no buffer size is set explicitly and may affect the TCP connection throughput. This could be a contributing factor to the connection issue experienced by the NodeManager service.

name:yarn.minicluster.yarn.nodemanager.resource.memory-mb
value:4096
relevant log:2-1-INFO       org.apache.hadoop.service.AbstractService: Service NodeManager failed in state STARTED; cause: org.apache.hadoop.yarn.exceptions.YarnRuntimeException: java.net.ConnectException: Call From ec2-52-88-167-9.us-west-2.compute.amazonaws.com/172.31.29.154 to 0.0.0.0:8031 failed on connection exception: java.net.ConnectException: Connection refused; For more details see:  http://wiki.apache.org/hadoop/ConnectionRefused
explanation:The memory allocated for the Yarn NodeManager is set to 4096MB. If the system does not have enough memory, it could cause the NodeManager service to fail.
