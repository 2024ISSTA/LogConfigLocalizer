fs.default.name,<missing>,1-ERROR org.apache.hadoop.hdfs.server.datanode.DataNode: java.lang.NullPointerException,"The NullPointerException at NameNode.getAddress indicates that the DataNode is trying to access the NameNode's address, which is not set. The fs.default.name configuration option is missing a value, which is likely the cause of this error."
dfs.blockreport.incremental.intervalMsec,0,1-ERROR org.apache.hadoop.hdfs.server.datanode.DataNode: java.lang.NullPointerException,"The dfs.blockreport.incremental.intervalMsec configuration option is set to 0, which means that the DataNode is not waiting between sending incremental block reports to the NameNode. This could be causing the NullPointerException if the NameNode is not ready to receive these reports."
