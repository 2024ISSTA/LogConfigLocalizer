name:fs.default.name
value:<missing>
relevant log:1-ERROR org.apache.hadoop.hdfs.server.datanode.DataNode: java.lang.NullPointerException
explanation:The NullPointerException at NameNode.getAddress indicates that the DataNode is trying to access the NameNode's address, which is not set. The fs.default.name configuration option is missing a value, which is likely the cause of this error.

name:dfs.blockreport.incremental.intervalMsec
value:0
relevant log:1-ERROR org.apache.hadoop.hdfs.server.datanode.DataNode: java.lang.NullPointerException
explanation:The dfs.blockreport.incremental.intervalMsec configuration option is set to 0, which means that the DataNode is not waiting between sending incremental block reports to the NameNode. This could be causing the NullPointerException if the NameNode is not ready to receive these reports.

name:yarn.nodemanager.logaggregation.threadpool-size-max
value:100
relevant log:1-ERROR org.apache.hadoop.hdfs.server.datanode.DataNode: java.lang.NullPointerException
explanation:The yarn.nodemanager.logaggregation.threadpool-size-max configuration option is set to 100, which could be causing the NullPointerException if the DataNode is trying to aggregate more logs than the thread pool can handle.
