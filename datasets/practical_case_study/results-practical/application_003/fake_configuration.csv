    JournalNode. This cache is used to serve edits for tailing via the RPC-based
    mechanism, and is only enabled when dfs.ha.tail-edits.in-progress is true.
    Transactions range in size but are around 200 bytes on average, so the
    default of 1MB can store around 5000 transactions."

    below dfs.namenode.edits.dir.minimum, HDFS will issue an error.

    This property defaults to 1."
