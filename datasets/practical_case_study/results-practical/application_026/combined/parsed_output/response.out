name:ha.failover-controller.graceful-fence.connection.retries
value:1
relevant log:1-Error java.lang.NullPointerExceptionat org.apache.hadoop.ha.ZKFailoverController.run(ZKFailoverController.java:188)

name:yarn.resourcemanager.nodemanager-connect-retries
value:<missing>
relevant log:1-Error java.lang.NullPointerExceptionat org.apache.hadoop.ha.ZKFailoverController.run(ZKFailoverController.java:188)
explanation: The configuration for the number of retries for the nodemanager to connect to the resourcemanager is missing. This could potentially lead to connection issues if the initial connection attempt fails.

name:dfs.datanode.handler.count
value:10
relevant log:1-Error java.lang.NullPointerExceptionat org.apache.hadoop.ha.ZKFailoverController.run(ZKFailoverController.java:188)
