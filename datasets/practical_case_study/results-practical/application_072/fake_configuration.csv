2,yarn.app.mapreduce.client.max-retries,3,"The number of client retries to the RM/HS before
    throwing exception. This is a layer above the ipc."
3,dfs.client.mmap.cache.size,256,"When zero-copy reads are used, the DFSClient keeps a cache of recently used
    memory mapped regions.  This parameter controls the maximum number of
    entries that we will keep in that cache.

    The larger this number is, the more file descriptors we will potentially
    use for memory-mapped files.  mmaped files also use virtual address space.
    You may need to increase your ulimit virtual address space limits before
    increasing the client mmap cache size.

    Note that you can still do zero-copy reads when this size is set to 0."

7,hadoop.security.groups.negative-cache.secs,30,"Expiration time for entries in the the negative user-to-group mapping
    caching, in seconds. This is useful when invalid users are retrying
    frequently. It is suggested to set a small value for this expiration, since
    a transient error in group lookup could temporarily lock out a legitimate
    user.

    Set this to zero or negative value to disable negative user-to-group caching."
8,dfs.client.socket.send.buffer.size,0,"Socket send buffer size for a write pipeline in DFSClient side.
    This may affect TCP connection throughput.
    If it is set to zero or negative value,
    no buffer size will be set explicitly,
    thus enable tcp auto-tuning on some system.
    The default value is 0."
9,mapreduce.job.end-notification.max.attempts,5,"The maximum number of times a URL will be read for providing job
    end notification. Cluster administrators can set this to limit how long
    after end of a job, the Application Master waits before exiting. Must be
    marked as final to prevent users from overriding this."
