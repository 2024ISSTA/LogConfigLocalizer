1,mapreduce.job.speculative.retry-after-speculate,15000,"The waiting time(ms) to do next round of speculation
  if there are tasks speculated in this round."
2,dfs.namenode.list.cache.directives.num.responses,100,"This value controls the number of cache directives that the NameNode will
    send over the wire in response to a listDirectives RPC."
3,dfs.namenode.read-lock-reporting-threshold-ms,5000,"When a read lock is held on the namenode for a long time,
    this will be logged as the lock is released. This sets how long the
    lock must be held for logging to occur."

    disks with the highest latency."
5,dfs.datanode.lock-reporting-threshold-ms,300,"When thread waits to obtain a lock, or a thread holds a lock for
    more than the threshold, a log message will be written. Note that
    dfs.lock.suppress.warning.interval ensures a single log message is
    emitted per interval for waiting threads and a single message for holding
    threads to avoid excessive logging."
6,mapreduce.job.local-fs.single-disk-limit.check.interval-ms,5000,Interval of disk limit check to run in ms.
7,dfs.datanode.socket.write.timeout,480000,Timeout in ms for clients socket writes to DataNodes.
8,dfs.client.refresh.read-block-locations.ms,0,Refreshing LocatedBlocks period. A value of 0 disables the feature.
9,mapreduce.input.fileinputformat.list-status.num-threads,1,"The number of threads to use to list and fetch block locations
  for the specified input paths. Note: multiple threads should not be used
  if a custom non thread-safe path filter is used."
