1,dfs.namenode.list.reencryption.status.num.responses,100,"When listing re-encryption status, the maximum number of zones
    that will be returned in a batch. Fetching the list incrementally in
    batches improves namenode performance."
2,dfs.namenode.decommission.max.concurrent.tracked.nodes,100,"The maximum number of decommission-in-progress or
    entering-maintenance datanodes nodes that will be tracked at one time by
    the namenode. Tracking these datanode consumes additional NN memory
    proportional to the number of blocks on the datnode. Having a conservative
    limit reduces the potential impact of decommissioning or maintenance of
    a large number of nodes at once.
      
    A value of 0 means no limit will be enforced."
3,ipc.client.connect.max.retries,10,"Indicates the number of retries a client will make to establish
               a server connection."
4,dfs.edit.log.transfer.timeout,30000,"Socket timeout for edit log transfer in milliseconds. This timeout
    should be configured such that normal edit log transfer for journal
    node syncing can complete successfully."
5,hadoop.security.kms.client.authentication.retry-count,1,Number of time to retry connecting to KMS on authentication failure
6,dfs.client.deadnode.detection.probe.deadnode.interval.ms,60000,Interval time in milliseconds for probing dead node behavior.
7,dfs.ha.fencing.ssh.connect-timeout,30000,"SSH connection timeout, in milliseconds, to use with the builtin
    sshfence fencer."
8,dfs.ha.tail-edits.rolledits.timeout,60,The timeout in seconds of calling rollEdits RPC on Active NN.
9,yarn.app.mapreduce.am.resource.cpu-vcores,1,The number of virtual CPU cores the MR AppMaster needs.
