hadoop.security.authentication,kerberos,1-Error java.lang.ClassCastException: class java.io.IOException cannot be cast to class org.apache.hadoop.ipc.RemoteException,"The error log indicates a ClassCastException between IOException and RemoteException, which are both related to the communication between Hadoop components. The configuration option ""hadoop.security.authentication"" is relevant because it controls the authentication method for Hadoop, and incorrect settings may lead to communication errors."
ipc.client.connect.max.retries,10,1-Error java.lang.ClassCastException: class java.io.IOException cannot be cast to class org.apache.hadoop.ipc.RemoteException,"The error log indicates a ClassCastException between IOException and RemoteException, which are both related to the communication between Hadoop components. The configuration option ""ipc.client.connect.max.retries"" is relevant because it controls the number of retries a client will make to establish a server connection. If this value is set too low, it may cause connection failures."
hadoop.security.kms.client.authentication.retry-count,1,1-Error java.lang.ClassCastException: class java.io.IOException cannot be cast to class org.apache.hadoop.ipc.RemoteException,"The error log indicates a ClassCastException between IOException and RemoteException, which are both related to the communication between Hadoop components. The configuration option ""hadoop.security.kms.client.authentication.retry-count"" is relevant because it controls the number of times to retry connecting to KMS on authentication failure. If this value is set too low, it may cause authentication failures."
