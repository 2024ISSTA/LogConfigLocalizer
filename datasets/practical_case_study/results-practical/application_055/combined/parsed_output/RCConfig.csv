yarn.application.classpath,<missing>,1-Could not find or load main class org.apache.hadoop.mapreduce.v2.app.MRAppMaster error,"The error message indicates that the system could not find or load the main class org.apache.hadoop.mapreduce.v2.app.MRAppMaster. This is likely due to the missing value in the yarn.application.classpath configuration option. This option is used to specify the classpath for YARN applications, and if it is not set, the system may not be able to find the necessary classes to run the application."
