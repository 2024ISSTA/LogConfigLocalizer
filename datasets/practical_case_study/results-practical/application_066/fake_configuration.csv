    This determines the total amount of block transfers to begin in
    one iteration, for satisfy the policy. The actual number is obtained by
    multiplying this multiplier with the total number of live nodes in the
    cluster. The result number is the number of blocks to begin transfers

    roll edit logs. Since the StandbyNode only reads from finalized
    log segments, the StandbyNode will only be as up-to-date as how
    often the logs are rolled. Note that failover triggers a log roll
    so the StandbyNode will be up to date before it becomes active.

    summarized and discarded. Default value is 128."
