  the property mapreduce.jobhistory.loadedtasks.cache.size is set to a
  positive value."

    (upload, commit, abort, delete...)"
2,mapreduce.jobhistory.cleaner.interval-ms,86400000,"How often the job history cleaner checks for files to delete,
  in milliseconds. Defaults to 86400000 (one day). Files are only deleted if
  they are older than mapreduce.jobhistory.max-age-ms."

  This is in addition to the number of active threads in fs.s3a.threads.max."
5,dfs.datanode.fsdatasetasyncdisk.max.threads.per.volume,4,"The maximum number of threads per volume used to process async disk
    operations on the datanode. These threads consume I/O and CPU at the
    same time. This will affect normal data node operations."

    and re-encrypt the edeks."
7,mapreduce.client.progressmonitor.pollinterval,1000,"The interval (in milliseconds) between which the JobClient
    reports status to the console and checks for job completion. You may want to set this
    to a lower value to make tests run faster on a single node system. Adjusting
    this value in production may lead to unwanted client-server traffic."

      DFSInputStreams. If a DFSClient opens many DFSInputStreams, increasing
      this may help refresh them all in a timely manner."
