name:yarn.nm.liveness-monitor.expiry-interval-ms
value:600000
relevant log:1-Exception when trying to cleanup container container_1701398500430_0101_01_000006: java.io.FileNotFoundException: /home/hadoop3/hadoop/tmp/nm-local-dir/nmPrivate/application_1701398500430_0101/container_1701398500430_0101_01_000006/container_1701398500430_0101_01_000006.pid (No such file or directory)
explanation: The FileNotFoundException in the log indicates that the system failed to find a specific file. This could be due to the NodeManager's liveness monitor's expiry interval being too short, causing premature cleanup of the container before the system has finished with it. The description of this configuration is missing, which might be the cause of this error.

name:dfs.datanode.fsdatasetasyncdisk.max.threads.per.volume
value:4
relevant log:1-Exception when trying to cleanup container container_1701398500430_0101_01_000006: java.io.FileNotFoundException: /home/hadoop3/hadoop/tmp/nm-local-dir/nmPrivate/application_1701398500430_0101/container_1701398500430_0101_01_000006/container_1701398500430_0101_01_000006.pid (No such file or directory)
explanation: The FileNotFoundException could also be due to the maximum number of threads per volume used to process async disk operations on the datanode being too low. This could cause the system to be unable to handle the volume of operations, leading to files being lost or not created in the first place.
