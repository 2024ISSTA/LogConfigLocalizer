0,dfs.block.misreplication.processing.limit,,Maximum number of blocks to process for initializing replication queues.
1,ha.zookeeper.session-timeout.ms,10000,"The session timeout to use when the ZKFC connects to ZooKeeper.
    Setting this value to a lower value implies that server crashes
    will be detected more quickly, but risks triggering failover too
    aggressively in the case of a transient error or network blip."
2,mapreduce.job.reducer.preempt.delay.sec,0,"The threshold (in seconds) after which an unsatisfied
      mapper request triggers reducer preemption when there is no anticipated
      headroom. If set to 0 or a negative value, the reducer is preempted as
      soon as lack of headroom is detected. Default is 0."
3,dfs.client.max.block.acquire.failures,3,Maximum failures allowed when trying to get block information from a specific datanode.
4,dfs.namenode.list.cache.pools.num.responses,100,"This value controls the number of cache pools that the NameNode will
    send over the wire in response to a listPools RPC."
5,yarn.app.mapreduce.client.job.retry-interval,2000,"The delay between getJob retries in ms for retries configured
  with yarn.app.mapreduce.client.job.max-retries."
6,dfs.namenode.stale.datanode.interval,30000,"Default time interval in milliseconds for marking a datanode as ""stale"",
    i.e., if the namenode has not received heartbeat msg from a datanode for
    more than this time interval, the datanode will be marked and treated 
    as ""stale"" by default. The stale interval cannot be too small since 
    otherwise this may cause too frequent change of stale states. 
    We thus set a minimum stale interval value (the default value is 3 times 
    of heartbeat interval) and guarantee that the stale interval cannot be less
    than the minimum value. A stale data node is avoided during lease/block
    recovery. It can be conditionally avoided for reads (see
    dfs.namenode.avoid.read.stale.datanode) and for writes (see
    dfs.namenode.avoid.write.stale.datanode)."
7,dfs.client.server-defaults.validity.period.ms,3600000,"The amount of milliseconds after which cached server defaults are updated.

    By default this parameter is set to 1 hour.
    Support multiple time unit suffix(case insensitive), as described
    in dfs.heartbeat.interval."
8,dfs.storage.policy.satisfier.work.multiplier.per.iteration,1,"*Note*: Advanced property. Change with caution.
    This determines the total amount of block transfers to begin in
    one iteration, for satisfy the policy. The actual number is obtained by
    multiplying this multiplier with the total number of live nodes in the
    cluster. The result number is the number of blocks to begin transfers
    immediately. This number can be any positive, non-zero integer."
9,dfs.namenode.retrycache.expirytime.millis,600000,The time for which retry cache entries are retained.
