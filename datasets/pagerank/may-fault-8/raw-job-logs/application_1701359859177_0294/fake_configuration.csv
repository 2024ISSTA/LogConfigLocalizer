2,dfs.datanode.directoryscan.throttle.limit.ms.per.sec,1000,"The report compilation threads are limited to only running for
  a given number of milliseconds per second, as configured by the
  property. The limit is taken per thread, not in aggregate, e.g. setting
  a limit of 100ms for 4 compiler threads will result in each thread being
  limited to 100ms, not 25ms.

  Note that the throttle does not interrupt the report compiler threads, so the
  actual running time of the threads per second will typically be somewhat
  higher than the throttle limit, usually by no more than 20%.

  Setting this limit to 1000 disables compiler thread throttling. Only
  values between 1 and 1000 are valid. Setting an invalid value will result
  in the throttle being disabled and an error message being logged. 1000 is
  the default setting."
