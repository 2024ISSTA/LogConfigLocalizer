2,ipc.[port_number].scheduler.priority.levels,4,"How many priority levels to use within the scheduler and call
    queue. This property applies to RpcScheduler and CallQueue."
3,dfs.client.retry.window.base,3000,"Base time window in ms for DFSClient retries.  For each retry attempt,
    this value is extended linearly (e.g. 3000 ms for first attempt and
    first retry, 6000 ms for second retry, 9000 ms for third retry, etc.)."
4,mapreduce.shuffle.transfer.buffer.size,131072,"This property is used only if
  mapreduce.shuffle.transferTo.allowed is set to false. In that case,
  this property defines the size of the buffer used in the buffer copy code
  for the shuffle phase. The size of this buffer determines the size of the IO
  requests."
5,dfs.namenode.startup.delay.block.deletion.sec,0,"The delay in seconds at which we will pause the blocks deletion
    after Namenode startup. By default it's disabled.
    In the case a directory has large number of directories and files are
    deleted, suggested delay is one hour to give the administrator enough time
    to notice large number of pending deletion blocks and take corrective
    action."

    send over the wire in response to a listPools RPC."
7,dfs.client.refresh.read-block-locations.threads,5,"Number of threads to use for refreshing LocatedBlocks of registered
      DFSInputStreams. If a DFSClient opens many DFSInputStreams, increasing
      this may help refresh them all in a timely manner."
