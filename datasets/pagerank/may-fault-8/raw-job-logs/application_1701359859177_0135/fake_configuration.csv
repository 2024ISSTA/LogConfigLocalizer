5,dfs.cachereport.intervalMsec,10000,"Determines cache reporting interval in milliseconds.  After this amount of
    time, the DataNode sends a full report of its cache state to the NameNode.
    The NameNode uses the cache report to update its map of cached blocks to
    DataNode locations.

    This configuration has no effect if in-memory caching has been disabled by
    setting dfs.datanode.max.locked.memory to 0 (which is the default).

    If the native libraries are not available to the DataNode, this
    configuration has no effect."
