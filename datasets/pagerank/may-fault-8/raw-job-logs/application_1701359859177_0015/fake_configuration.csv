0,yarn.resourcemanager.container.liveness-monitor.interval-ms,,
1,fs.s3a.connection.request.timeout,0,"Time out on HTTP requests to the AWS service; 0 means no timeout.
    Measured in seconds; the usual time suffixes are all supported

    Important: this is the maximum duration of any AWS service call,
    including upload and copy operations. If non-zero, it must be larger
    than the time to upload multi-megabyte blocks to S3 from the client,
    and to rename many-GB files. Use with care.

    Values that are larger than Integer.MAX_VALUE milliseconds are
    converged to Integer.MAX_VALUE milliseconds"
2,dfs.block.access.token.lifetime,600,The lifetime of access tokens in minutes.
3,dfs.namenode.replication.max-streams,2,Hard limit for the number of replication streams other than those with highest-priority.
4,dfs.client.write.byte-array-manager.count-limit,2048,The maximum number of arrays allowed for each array length.
5,dfs.namenode.list.cache.pools.num.responses,100,"This value controls the number of cache pools that the NameNode will
    send over the wire in response to a listPools RPC."
6,yarn.app.mapreduce.am.containerlauncher.threadpool-initial-size,10,"The initial size of thread pool to launch containers in the
    app master."
7,dfs.client.socketcache.capacity,16,"Socket cache capacity (in entries) for short-circuit reads.
    If this value is set to 0, the client socket cache is disabled."
8,dfs.edit.log.transfer.bandwidthPerSec,0,"Maximum bandwidth used for transferring edit log to between journal nodes
    for syncing, in bytes per second.
    A default value of 0 indicates that throttling is disabled."
9,mapreduce.reduce.merge.inmem.threshold,1000,"The threshold, in terms of the number of files
  for the in-memory merge process. When we accumulate threshold number of files
  we initiate the in-memory merge and spill to disk. A value of 0 or less than
  0 indicates we want to DON'T have any threshold and instead depend only on
  the ramfs's memory consumption to trigger the merge."
