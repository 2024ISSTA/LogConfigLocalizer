2,dfs.image.parallel.threads,4,"The number of threads to use when dfs.image.parallel.load is
        enabled. This setting should be less than
        dfs.image.parallel.target.sections. The optimal number of
        threads will depend on the hardware and environment."
3,dfs.datanode.lock-reporting-threshold-ms,300,"When thread waits to obtain a lock, or a thread holds a lock for
    more than the threshold, a log message will be written. Note that
    dfs.lock.suppress.warning.interval ensures a single log message is
    emitted per interval for waiting threads and a single message for holding
    threads to avoid excessive logging."
4,fs.s3a.connection.request.timeout,0,"Time out on HTTP requests to the AWS service; 0 means no timeout.
    Measured in seconds; the usual time suffixes are all supported

    Important: this is the maximum duration of any AWS service call,
    including upload and copy operations. If non-zero, it must be larger
    than the time to upload multi-megabyte blocks to S3 from the client,
    and to rename many-GB files. Use with care.

    Values that are larger than Integer.MAX_VALUE milliseconds are
    converged to Integer.MAX_VALUE milliseconds"
5,mapreduce.shuffle.transfer.buffer.size,131072,"This property is used only if
  mapreduce.shuffle.transferTo.allowed is set to false. In that case,
  this property defines the size of the buffer used in the buffer copy code
  for the shuffle phase. The size of this buffer determines the size of the IO
  requests."

7,dfs.client.failover.sleep.base.millis,500,"Expert only. The time to wait, in milliseconds, between failover
    attempts increases exponentially as a function of the number of
    attempts made so far, with a random factor of +/- 50%. This option
    specifies the base value used in the failover calculation. The
    first failover will retry immediately. The 2nd failover attempt
    will delay at least dfs.client.failover.sleep.base.millis
    milliseconds. And so on."
