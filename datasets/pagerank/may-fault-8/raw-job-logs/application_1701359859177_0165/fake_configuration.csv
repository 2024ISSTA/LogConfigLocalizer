      signature exceeds the maximum allowed bytes in server, the caller context
      will be abandoned, in which case the caller context will not be recorded
      in audit logs."

    this will be logged as the lock is released. This sets how long the
    lock must be held for logging to occur."

9,hadoop.security.kms.client.failover.sleep.max.millis,2000,"Expert only. The time to wait, in milliseconds, between failover
    attempts increases exponentially as a function of the number of
    attempts made so far, with a random factor of +/- 50%. This option
    specifies the maximum value to wait between failovers.
    Specifically, the time between two failover attempts will not
    exceed +/- 50% of hadoop.security.client.failover.sleep.max.millis
    milliseconds."
