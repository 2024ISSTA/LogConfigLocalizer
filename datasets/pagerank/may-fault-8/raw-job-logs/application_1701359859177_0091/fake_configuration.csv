0,hadoop.zk.timeout-ms,0.4302914,"ZooKeeper session timeout in milliseconds. Session expiration
    is managed by the ZooKeeper cluster itself, not by the client. This value is
    used by the cluster to determine when the client's session expires.
    Expirations happens when the cluster does not hear from the client within
    the specified session timeout period (i.e. no heartbeat)."

    1MB. Values of the length less than the chunk size is
    guaranteed to have known value length in read time (See also
    TFile.Reader.Scanner.Entry.isValueLengthKnown())."
2,mapreduce.shuffle.max.connections,0,"Max allowed connections for the shuffle.  Set to 0 (zero)
               to indicate no limit on the number of connections."

5,fs.trash.checkpoint.interval,0,"Number of minutes between trash checkpoints.
  Should be smaller or equal to fs.trash.interval. If zero,
  the value is set to the value of fs.trash.interval.
  Every time the checkpointer runs it creates a new checkpoint

        fsimage for each section. This should be larger than
        dfs.image.parallel.threads, otherwise all threads will not be
        used when loading. Ideally, have at least twice the number
        of target sections as threads, so each thread must load more
        than one section to avoid one long running section affecting
        the load time."

    With this value and dfs.heartbeat.interval, the interval of
