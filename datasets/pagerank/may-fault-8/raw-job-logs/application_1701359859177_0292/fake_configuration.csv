               connections will be inspected for idleness."
1,io.bytes.per.checksum,512,"The number of bytes per checksum.  Must not be larger than
  io.file.buffer.size."

3,ftp.blocksize,67108864,Block size
4,yarn.app.mapreduce.client.job.max-retries,3,"The number of retries the client will make for getJob and
    dependent calls.
    This is needed for non-HDFS DFS where additional, high level
    retries are required to avoid spurious failures during the getJob call.
    30 is a good value for WASB"
5,dfs.namenode.fs-limits.min-block-size,1048576,"Minimum block size in bytes, enforced by the Namenode at create
      time. This prevents the accidental creation of files with tiny block
      sizes (and thus many blocks), which can degrade performance. Support multiple
      size unit suffix(case insensitive), as described in dfs.blocksize."

8,dfs.datanode.handler.count,10,The number of server threads for the datanode.
9,dfs.datanode.data.transfer.bandwidthPerSec,0,"Specifies the maximum amount of bandwidth that the data transfering can utilize for transfering block when
      BlockConstructionStage is
      PIPELINE_SETUP_CREATE and clientName is empty.
      When the bandwidth value is zero, there is no limit."
