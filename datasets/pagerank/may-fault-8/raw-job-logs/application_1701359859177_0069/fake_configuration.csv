2,dfs.datanode.max.locked.memory,0,"The amount of memory in bytes to use for caching of block replicas in
    memory on the datanode. The datanode's maximum locked memory soft ulimit
    (RLIMIT_MEMLOCK) must be set to at least this value, else the datanode
    will abort on startup. Support multiple size unit suffix(case insensitive),
    as described in dfs.blocksize.

    By default, this parameter is set to 0, which disables in-memory caching.

    If the native libraries are not available to the DataNode, this
    configuration has no effect."

9,hadoop.fuse.connection.timeout,300,"The minimum number of seconds that we'll cache libhdfs connection objects
    in fuse_dfs. Lower values will result in lower memory consumption; higher
    values may speed up access by avoiding the overhead of creating new
    connection objects."
