0,hadoop.fuse.connection.timeout,-299075894,"The minimum number of seconds that we'll cache libhdfs connection objects
    in fuse_dfs. Lower values will result in lower memory consumption; higher
    values may speed up access by avoiding the overhead of creating new
    connection objects."
1,ha.health-monitor.rpc.connect.max.retries,1,"The number of retries on connect error when establishing RPC proxy
    connection to NameNode, used for monitorHealth() calls."
2,dfs.qjournal.http.read.timeout.ms,60000,"Timeout in milliseconds when reading from a HTTP connection from remote
    journals."
3,dfs.disk.balancer.plan.threshold.percent,10,"The percentage threshold value for volume Data Density in a plan.
      If the absolute value of volume Data Density which is out of
      threshold value in a node, it means that the volumes corresponding to
      the disks should do the balancing in the plan. The default value is 10."
4,fs.s3a.paging.maximum,5000,"How many keys to request from S3 when doing
     directory listings at a time."
5,dfs.namenode.top.window.num.buckets,10,Number of buckets in the rolling window implementation of nntop
6,yarn.client.failover-retries,0,
7,dfs.datanode.fsdatasetcache.max.threads.per.volume,4,"The maximum number of threads per volume to use for caching new data
    on the datanode. These threads consume both I/O and CPU. This can affect
    normal datanode operations."
8,mapreduce.job.ubertask.maxreduces,1,"Threshold for number of reduces, beyond which job is considered
  too big for the ubertasking optimization.  CURRENTLY THE CODE CANNOT SUPPORT
  MORE THAN ONE REDUCE and will ignore larger values.  (Zero is a valid max,
  however.)  Users may override this value, but only downward."
9,dfs.datanode.metrics.logger.period.seconds,600,"This setting controls how frequently the DataNode logs its metrics. The
    logging configuration must also define one or more appenders for
    DataNodeMetricsLog for the metrics to be logged.
    DataNode metrics logging is disabled if this value is set to zero or
    less than zero."
