0,mapreduce.task.combine.progress.records,-531162184,"The number of records to process during combine output collection
   before sending a progress notification."
1,dfs.namenode.edekcacheloader.interval.ms,1000,"When KeyProvider is configured, the interval time of warming
    up edek cache on NN starts up / becomes active. All edeks will be loaded
    from KMS into provider cache. The edek cache loader will try to warm up the
    cache until succeed or NN leaves active state."
2,dfs.ha.tail-edits.period.backoff-max,0,"The maximum time the tailer should wait between checking for new edit log
    entries. Exponential backoff will be applied when an edit log tail is
    performed but no edits are available to be read. Values less than or
    equal to zero disable backoff entirely; this is the default behavior.
    Supports multiple time unit suffix (case insensitive), as described
    in dfs.heartbeat.interval."

    block list."
4,mapreduce.shuffle.transfer.buffer.size,131072,"This property is used only if
  mapreduce.shuffle.transferTo.allowed is set to false. In that case,
  this property defines the size of the buffer used in the buffer copy code
  for the shuffle phase. The size of this buffer determines the size of the IO
  requests."

    related to decommission and maintenance operations that can be loaded
    into the replication queue at any given time. Every
    dfs.namenode.decommission.interval seconds, the list is checked to see if
    the blocks have become fully replicated and then further blocks are added
    to reach the limit defined in this parameter."
8,dfs.client.refresh.read-block-locations.threads,5,"Number of threads to use for refreshing LocatedBlocks of registered
      DFSInputStreams. If a DFSClient opens many DFSInputStreams, increasing

    The default is 15 minutes. The unit is minutes."
