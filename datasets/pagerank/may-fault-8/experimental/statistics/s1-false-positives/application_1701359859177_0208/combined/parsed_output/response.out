name:mapreduce.task.combine.progress.records
value:-531162184
relevant log:1-INFO	DefaultSpeculator.addSpeculativeAttempt -- we are speculating task_1701359859177_0208_m_000010
explanation:The log indicates that a speculative task is being created, which is related to the mapreduce process. The configuration 'mapreduce.task.combine.progress.records' has a negative value, which is not valid as it represents the number of records to process during combine output collection before sending a progress notification. This could be the root cause of the anomaly.

name:dfs.ha.tail-edits.period.backoff-max
value:0
relevant log:1-INFO	DefaultSpeculator.addSpeculativeAttempt -- we are speculating task_1701359859177_0208_m_000010
explanation:The configuration 'dfs.ha.tail-edits.period.backoff-max' has a value of 0, which disables backoff entirely. This could lead to issues if there are no edits available to be read when an edit log tail is performed. This could be related to the anomaly in the log.

name:mapreduce.shuffle.transfer.buffer.size
value:131072
relevant log:1-INFO	DefaultSpeculator.addSpeculativeAttempt -- we are speculating task_1701359859177_0208_m_000010
explanation:The log indicates a speculative task related to the mapreduce process. The configuration 'mapreduce.shuffle.transfer.buffer.size' defines the size of the buffer used in the buffer copy code for the shuffle phase. If this buffer size is not sufficient, it could lead to anomalies in the mapreduce process.
