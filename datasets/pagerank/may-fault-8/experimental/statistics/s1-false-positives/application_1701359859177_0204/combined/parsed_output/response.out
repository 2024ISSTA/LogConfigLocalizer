value:1
relevant log:1-INFO	DefaultSpeculator.addSpeculativeAttempt -- we are speculating task_1701359859177_0204_r_000008
explanation: The log indicates that the system is speculating a task, which might be related to the resource manager's placement constraints. The pool size of 1 might be too small, causing the system to speculate tasks.

value:3
relevant log:1-INFO	DefaultSpeculator.addSpeculativeAttempt -- we are speculating task_1701359859177_0204_r_000008
explanation: The log indicates that the system is speculating a task, which might be related to the job history move thread count. The value of 3 might be too low, causing the system to speculate tasks.

relevant log:1-INFO	DefaultSpeculator.addSpeculativeAttempt -- we are speculating task_1701359859177_0204_r_000008
explanation: The log indicates that the system is speculating a task, which might be related to the maximum size a map reduce job is allowed to submit for localization. The value of 0 means the limit is ignored, which might cause the system to speculate tasks.
