hadoop.fuse.connection.timeout,-299075894,1-INFO	DefaultSpeculator.addSpeculativeAttempt -- we are speculating task_1701359859177_0139_r_000009,The negative value for the connection timeout could be causing issues with the task speculation. This value should be a positive number representing the number of seconds to cache libhdfs connection objects.
mapreduce.input.lineinputformat.linespermap,1,1-INFO	DefaultSpeculator.addSpeculativeAttempt -- we are speculating task_1701359859177_0139_r_000009,The value of 1 for linespermap could be causing inefficient task distribution. This value should be adjusted based on the size of the input data to optimize task distribution.
ha.health-monitor.rpc.connect.max.retries,1,1-INFO	DefaultSpeculator.addSpeculativeAttempt -- we are speculating task_1701359859177_0139_r_000009,The low number of retries on connect error could be causing issues with the task speculation. This value should be increased to allow for more retries when establishing RPC proxy connection to NameNode.
