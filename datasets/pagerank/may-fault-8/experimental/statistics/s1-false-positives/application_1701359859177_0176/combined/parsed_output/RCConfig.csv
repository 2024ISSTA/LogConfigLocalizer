The configuration option 'yarn.app.mapreduce.am.containerlauncher.threadpool-initial-size' determines the initial size of the thread pool to launch containers in the app master. If this value is too low, it may cause delays or failures in launching speculative tasks."

The configuration option 'mapreduce.job.maxtaskfailures.per.tracker' determines the number of task-failures on a node manager of a given job after which new tasks of that job aren't assigned to it. If this value is too low, it may cause premature speculation of tasks."
