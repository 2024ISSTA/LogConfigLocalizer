io.bytes.per.checksum,<missing>,1-INFO	DefaultSpeculator.addSpeculativeAttempt -- we are speculating task_1701359859177_0082_r_000008,"The configuration 'io.bytes.per.checksum' is missing a value. This configuration is important for determining the number of bytes per checksum, which is crucial for data integrity during data transfer. The absence of this value could lead to data corruption or loss during the task execution."
fs.s3a.connection.request.timeout,0,1-INFO	DefaultSpeculator.addSpeculativeAttempt -- we are speculating task_1701359859177_0082_r_000008,"The configuration 'fs.s3a.connection.request.timeout' is set to 0, which means there is no timeout for HTTP requests to the AWS service. This could potentially lead to tasks hanging indefinitely if there are issues with the connection or the AWS service."
mapreduce.shuffle.transfer.buffer.size,131072,1-INFO	DefaultSpeculator.addSpeculativeAttempt -- we are speculating task_1701359859177_0082_r_000008,"The configuration 'mapreduce.shuffle.transfer.buffer.size' is set to 131072. This property defines the size of the buffer used in the buffer copy code for the shuffle phase. If this value is not properly set, it could affect the performance of the shuffle phase during task execution."
