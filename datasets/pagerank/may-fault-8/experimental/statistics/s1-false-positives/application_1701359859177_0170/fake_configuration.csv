2,dfs.datanode.min.outlier.detection.nodes,10,Minimum number of nodes to run outlier detection.
3,dfs.client.max.block.acquire.failures,3,Maximum failures allowed when trying to get block information from a specific datanode.
4,dfs.datanode.max.slowdisks.to.exclude,0,"The number of slow disks that needs to be excluded. By default, this parameter is set to 0,
    which disables excluding slow disk when choosing volume."
5,dfs.datanode.directoryscan.threads,1,"How many threads should the threadpool used to compile reports
  for volumes in parallel have."
6,dfs.client.failover.sleep.base.millis,500,"Expert only. The time to wait, in milliseconds, between failover
    attempts increases exponentially as a function of the number of
    attempts made so far, with a random factor of +/- 50%. This option
    specifies the base value used in the failover calculation. The
    first failover will retry immediately. The 2nd failover attempt
    will delay at least dfs.client.failover.sleep.base.millis
    milliseconds. And so on."

    stopped using a replica that the DataNode wants to uncache."
9,hadoop.zk.timeout-ms,10000,"ZooKeeper session timeout in milliseconds. Session expiration
    is managed by the ZooKeeper cluster itself, not by the client. This value is
    used by the cluster to determine when the client's session expires.
    Expirations happens when the cluster does not hear from the client within
    the specified session timeout period (i.e. no heartbeat)."
