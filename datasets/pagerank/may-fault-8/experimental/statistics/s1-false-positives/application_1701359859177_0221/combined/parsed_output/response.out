name:yarn.dispatcher.drain-events.timeout
value:0
relevant log:1-INFO	DefaultSpeculator.addSpeculativeAttempt -- we are speculating task_1701359859177_0221_r_000008
explanation:The log indicates that a speculative task is being added, which might be due to the yarn.dispatcher.drain-events.timeout being set to 0. This could cause the system to speculate tasks prematurely.

name:dfs.balancer.dispatcherThreads
value:200
relevant log:1-INFO	DefaultSpeculator.addSpeculativeAttempt -- we are speculating task_1701359859177_0221_r_000008
explanation:The high number of dispatcher threads could be causing an overload in the system, leading to the speculation of tasks as indicated in the log.

name:dfs.datanode.slow.io.warning.threshold.ms
value:300
relevant log:1-INFO	DefaultSpeculator.addSpeculativeAttempt -- we are speculating task_1701359859177_0221_r_000008
explanation:The log indicates a speculative task, which could be due to slow IO operations. The threshold for slow IO warnings is set to 300ms, which might be too high, causing the system to speculate tasks due to perceived slow operations.
