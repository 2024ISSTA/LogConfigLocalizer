name:io.bytes.per.checksum
value:<missing>
relevant log:1-INFO	DefaultSpeculator.addSpeculativeAttempt -- we are speculating task_1701359859177_0253_r_000009
explanation:The value for this configuration is missing. This configuration is important for the integrity of data. The absence of this value could lead to data corruption or loss.

name:mapreduce.job.reduces
value:1
relevant log:1-INFO	DefaultSpeculator.addSpeculativeAttempt -- we are speculating task_1701359859177_0253_r_000009
explanation:The log indicates that a speculative task was created, which is often due to slow running tasks. The value of this configuration is set to 1, which means only one reduce task is allowed per job. This could be the cause of the slow running tasks and hence the speculation.

name:ipc.server.max.connections
value:0
relevant log:1-INFO	DefaultSpeculator.addSpeculativeAttempt -- we are speculating task_1701359859177_0253_r_000009
explanation:The value of this configuration is set to 0, which means there is no limit to the number of concurrent connections a server is allowed to accept. This could potentially lead to resource exhaustion and slow down the system, leading to the creation of speculative tasks.
