io.bytes.per.checksum,<missing>,1-INFO	DefaultSpeculator.addSpeculativeAttempt -- we are speculating task_1701359859177_0270_r_000008,The configuration 'io.bytes.per.checksum' is missing a value. This configuration is important for determining the number of bytes per checksum. A missing value could lead to issues with data integrity and performance.
yarn.app.mapreduce.am.container.log.backups,0,1-INFO	DefaultSpeculator.addSpeculativeAttempt -- we are speculating task_1701359859177_0270_r_000008,The configuration 'yarn.app.mapreduce.am.container.log.backups' is set to 0. This means that no backup files for the ApplicationMaster logs are being created when using ContainerRollingLogAppender (CRLA). This could lead to loss of important log information.
mapreduce.input.fileinputformat.list-status.num-threads,1,1-INFO	DefaultSpeculator.addSpeculativeAttempt -- we are speculating task_1701359859177_0270_r_000008,"The configuration 'mapreduce.input.fileinputformat.list-status.num-threads' is set to 1. This means that only one thread is used to list and fetch block locations for the specified input paths. This could lead to performance issues, especially for large data sets."
