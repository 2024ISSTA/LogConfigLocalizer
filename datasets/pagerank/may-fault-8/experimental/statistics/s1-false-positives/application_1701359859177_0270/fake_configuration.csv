    ContainerRollingLogAppender (CRLA). See
    org.apache.log4j.RollingFileAppender.maxBackupIndex. By default,
    ContainerLogAppender (CLA) is used, and container logs are not rolled. CRLA

    threshold then it will send block reports for all Storage Directories
    in a single message.

    If the number of blocks exceeds this threshold then the DataNode will
    send block reports for each Storage Directory in separate messages.
