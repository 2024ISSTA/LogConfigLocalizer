0,ipc.client.idlethreshold,,"Defines the threshold number of connections after which
               connections will be inspected for idleness."
1,dfs.client.failover.sleep.max.millis,15000,"Expert only. The time to wait, in milliseconds, between failover
    attempts increases exponentially as a function of the number of
    attempts made so far, with a random factor of +/- 50%. This option
    specifies the maximum value to wait between failovers. 
    Specifically, the time between two failover attempts will not
    exceed +/- 50% of dfs.client.failover.sleep.max.millis
    milliseconds."
2,fs.s3a.connection.timeout,200000,Socket connection timeout in milliseconds.
3,io.bytes.per.checksum,512,"The number of bytes per checksum.  Must not be larger than
  io.file.buffer.size."
4,dfs.edit.log.transfer.timeout,30000,"Socket timeout for edit log transfer in milliseconds. This timeout
    should be configured such that normal edit log transfer for journal
    node syncing can complete successfully."
5,nfs.mountd.port,4242,Specify the port number used by Hadoop mount daemon.
6,yarn.app.mapreduce.am.scheduler.heartbeat.interval-ms,1000,"The interval in ms at which the MR AppMaster should send
    heartbeats to the ResourceManager"
7,dfs.storage.policy.satisfier.datanode.cache.refresh.interval.ms,300000,"How often to refresh the datanode storages cache in milliseconds. This cache
    keeps live datanode storage reports fetched from namenode. After elapsed time,
    it will again fetch latest datanodes from namenode.
    By default, this parameter is set to 5 minutes."
8,mapreduce.task.timeout,600000,"The number of milliseconds before a task will be
  terminated if it neither reads an input, writes an output, nor
  updates its status string.  A value of 0 disables the timeout."
9,yarn.app.mapreduce.client-am.ipc.max-retries,3,"The number of client retries to the AM - before reconnecting
    to the RM to fetch Application Status.
    In other words, it is the ipc.client.connect.max.retries to be used during
    reconnecting to the RM and fetching Application Status."
