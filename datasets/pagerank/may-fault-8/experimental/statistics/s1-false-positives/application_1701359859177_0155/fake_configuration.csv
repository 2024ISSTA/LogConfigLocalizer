0,dfs.datanode.du.reserved.pct,0.97344786,"Reserved space in percentage. Read dfs.datanode.du.reserved.calculator to see
    when this takes effect. The actual number of bytes reserved will be calculated by using the
    total capacity of the data directory in question. Specific storage type based reservation
    is also supported. The property can be followed with corresponding storage types
    ([ssd]/[disk]/[archive]/[ram_disk]) for cluster with heterogeneous storage.
    For example, reserved percentage space for RAM_DISK storage can be configured using property
    'dfs.datanode.du.reserved.pct.ram_disk'. If specific storage type reservation is not configured
    then dfs.datanode.du.reserved.pct will be used."
1,dfs.client.failover.sleep.max.millis,15000,"Expert only. The time to wait, in milliseconds, between failover
    attempts increases exponentially as a function of the number of
    attempts made so far, with a random factor of +/- 50%. This option
    specifies the maximum value to wait between failovers. 
    Specifically, the time between two failover attempts will not
    exceed +/- 50% of dfs.client.failover.sleep.max.millis
    milliseconds."
2,ipc.maximum.response.length,134217728,"This indicates the maximum IPC message length (bytes) that can be
    accepted by the client. Messages larger than this value are rejected
    immediately to avoid possible OOMs. This setting should rarely need to be
    changed.  Set to 0 to disable."
3,dfs.balancer.service.retries.on.exception,5,"When the balancer is executed as a long-running service, it will retry upon encountering an exception. This
    configuration determines how many times it will retry before considering the exception to be fatal and quitting."
4,hadoop.security.group.mapping.ldap.num.attempts,3,"This property is the number of attempts to be made for LDAP operations.
    If this limit is exceeded, LdapGroupsMapping will return an empty
    group list."
5,yarn.client.failover-retries,0,
6,dfs.namenode.num.checkpoints.retained,2,"The number of image checkpoint files (fsimage_*) that will be retained by
  the NameNode and Secondary NameNode in their storage directories. All edit
  logs (stored on edits_* files) necessary to recover an up-to-date namespace from the oldest retained
  checkpoint will also be retained."
7,mapreduce.job.max.split.locations,15,"The max number of block locations to store for each split for
    locality calculation."
8,dfs.datanode.lazywriter.interval.sec,60,Interval in seconds for Datanodes for lazy persist writes.
9,mapreduce.jobhistory.loadedjobs.cache.size,5,"Size of the loaded job cache.  This property is ignored if
  the property mapreduce.jobhistory.loadedtasks.cache.size is set to a
  positive value."
