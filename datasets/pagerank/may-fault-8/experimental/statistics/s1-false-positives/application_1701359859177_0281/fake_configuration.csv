    journals."
1,yarn.app.mapreduce.client-am.ipc.max-retries,3,"The number of client retries to the AM - before reconnecting
    to the RM to fetch Application Status.
    In other words, it is the ipc.client.connect.max.retries to be used during
    reconnecting to the RM and fetching Application Status."
2,io.map.index.interval,128,"MapFile consist of two files - data file (tuples) and index file
    (keys). For every io.map.index.interval records written in the
    data file, an entry (record-key, data-file-position) is written
    in the index file. This is to allow for doing binary search later
    within the index file to look up records by their keys and get their
    closest positions in the data file."

6,dfs.client.short.circuit.num,1,"Number of short-circuit caches. This setting should
    be in the range 1 - 5. Lower values will result in lower CPU consumption; higher
    values may speed up massive parallel reading files."
