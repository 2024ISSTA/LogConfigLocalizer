yarn.app.mapreduce.am.container.log.limit.kb,0,1-INFO	DefaultSpeculator.addSpeculativeAttempt -- we are speculating task_1701359859177_0188_r_000009,"The log indicates a speculative task attempt, which could generate additional logs. However, the configuration for the maximum size of the MRAppMaster attempt container logs is set to 0, which disables the cap. This could potentially cause issues with log management and tracking of speculative tasks."
dfs.block.misreplication.processing.limit,<missing>,1-INFO	DefaultSpeculator.addSpeculativeAttempt -- we are speculating task_1701359859177_0188_r_000009,"The log indicates a speculative task attempt, which could potentially cause misreplication of blocks. However, the configuration for the maximum number of blocks to process for initializing replication queues is missing. This could potentially cause issues with block replication and data consistency."
mapreduce.input.fileinputformat.split.minsize,0,1-INFO	DefaultSpeculator.addSpeculativeAttempt -- we are speculating task_1701359859177_0188_r_000009,"The log indicates a speculative task attempt, which could involve splitting of input files. However, the configuration for the minimum size chunk that map input should be split into is set to 0. This could potentially cause issues with task distribution and performance."
