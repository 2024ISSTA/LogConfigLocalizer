    a NameNode per second. Values less than or equal to 0 disable throttling.
    This affects anything that uses a NameNodeConnector, i.e., the Balancer,
    Mover, and StoragePolicySatisfier."
1,dfs.datanode.cache.revocation.timeout.ms,900000,"When the DFSClient reads from a block file which the DataNode is
    caching, the DFSClient can skip verifying checksums.  The DataNode will
    keep the block file in cache until the client is done.  If the client takes
    an unusually long time, though, the DataNode may need to evict the block
    file from the cache anyway.  This value controls how long the DataNode will
    wait for the client to release a replica that it is reading without
    checksums."
