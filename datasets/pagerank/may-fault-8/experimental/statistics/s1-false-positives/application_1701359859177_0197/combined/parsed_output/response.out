name:io.bytes.per.checksum
value:<missing>
relevant log:1-INFO	DefaultSpeculator.addSpeculativeAttempt -- we are speculating task_1701359859177_0197_r_000008
explanation:The configuration 'io.bytes.per.checksum' is missing a value. This configuration is important for the system to know how many bytes per checksum it should consider. The absence of this value could lead to issues in the system's ability to correctly speculate tasks.

name:fs.s3a.executor.capacity
value:16
relevant log:1-INFO	DefaultSpeculator.addSpeculativeAttempt -- we are speculating task_1701359859177_0197_r_000008
explanation:The configuration 'fs.s3a.executor.capacity' is set to 16. This configuration determines the maximum number of tasks that can be submitted simultaneously for execution. If the number of tasks exceeds this value, it could lead to overloading of the thread pool, which might be the cause of the speculation of the task mentioned in the log.

name:yarn.nm.liveness-monitor.expiry-interval-ms
value:600000
relevant log:1-INFO	DefaultSpeculator.addSpeculativeAttempt -- we are speculating task_1701359859177_0197_r_000008
explanation:The configuration 'yarn.nm.liveness-monitor.expiry-interval-ms' is set to 600000. This configuration is responsible for monitoring the liveness of the NodeManager. If the NodeManager is not responding within this interval, it could lead to speculation of tasks as seen in the log.
