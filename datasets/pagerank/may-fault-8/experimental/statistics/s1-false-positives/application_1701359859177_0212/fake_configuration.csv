0,mapreduce.job.split.metainfo.maxsize,0,"The maximum permissible size of the split metainfo file.
  The MapReduce ApplicationMaster won't attempt to read submitted split metainfo
  files bigger than this configured value.
  No limits if set to -1."
1,file.replication,1,Replication factor
2,dfs.client.short.circuit.replica.stale.threshold.ms,1800000,"The maximum amount of time that we will consider a short-circuit replica to
    be valid, if there is no communication from the DataNode.  After this time
    has elapsed, we will re-fetch the short-circuit replica even if it is in
    the cache."

  dfs.stream-buffer-size"

6,dfs.namenode.edits.dir.minimum,1,"dfs.namenode.edits.dir includes both required directories
    (specified by dfs.namenode.edits.dir.required) and optional directories.

    The number of usable optional directories must be greater than or equal
    to this property.  If the number of usable optional directories falls
    below dfs.namenode.edits.dir.minimum, HDFS will issue an error.

    This property defaults to 1."
