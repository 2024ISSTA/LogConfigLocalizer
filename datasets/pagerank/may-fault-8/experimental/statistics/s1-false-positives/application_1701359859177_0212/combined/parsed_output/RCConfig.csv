mapreduce.job.split.metainfo.maxsize,0,1-INFO	DefaultSpeculator.addSpeculativeAttempt -- we are speculating task_1701359859177_0213_r_000008,"The log indicates that a speculative task is being attempted. This could be due to the configuration of 'mapreduce.job.split.metainfo.maxsize' being set to 0, which means the MapReduce ApplicationMaster won't attempt to read submitted split metainfo files. This could potentially cause issues with task speculation."
mapreduce.job.maxtaskfailures.per.tracker,3,1-INFO	DefaultSpeculator.addSpeculativeAttempt -- we are speculating task_1701359859177_0213_r_000008,"The log indicates that a speculative task is being attempted. This could be due to the configuration of 'mapreduce.job.maxtaskfailures.per.tracker' being set to 3, which means after 3 task-failures on a node manager of a given job, new tasks of that job aren't assigned to it. This could potentially cause issues with task assignment and speculation."
yarn.app.mapreduce.am.resource.cpu-vcores,1,1-INFO	DefaultSpeculator.addSpeculativeAttempt -- we are speculating task_1701359859177_0213_r_000008,"The log indicates that a speculative task is being attempted. This could be due to the configuration of 'yarn.app.mapreduce.am.resource.cpu-vcores' being set to 1, which means the MR AppMaster only has 1 virtual CPU core. This could potentially cause issues with task processing and speculation."
