io.bytes.per.checksum,<missing>,1-INFO	DefaultSpeculator.addSpeculativeAttempt -- we are speculating task_1701359859177_0166_r_000008,"The configuration 'io.bytes.per.checksum' is missing a value. This could potentially cause issues with data integrity during data transfer operations, which might be related to the speculative task mentioned in the log."
dfs.client.failover.connection.retries.on.timeouts,0,1-INFO	DefaultSpeculator.addSpeculativeAttempt -- we are speculating task_1701359859177_0166_r_000008,The configuration 'dfs.client.failover.connection.retries.on.timeouts' is set to 0. This means that no retry attempts will be made on socket timeout when establishing a server connection. This could potentially cause issues with task speculation if the connection to the server is lost.
dfs.datanode.max.transfer.threads,4096,1-INFO	DefaultSpeculator.addSpeculativeAttempt -- we are speculating task_1701359859177_0166_r_000008,"The configuration 'dfs.datanode.max.transfer.threads' is set to a high value. This could potentially cause resource contention issues, which might be related to the speculative task mentioned in the log."
