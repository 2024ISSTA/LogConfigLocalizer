relevant log:1-INFO	DefaultSpeculator.addSpeculativeAttempt -- we are speculating task_1701359859177_0012_r_000009
explanation:The dfs.blockreport.incremental.intervalMsec configuration is set to 0, which means that the Datanode is not sending incremental block reports to the Namenode. This could be causing issues with the task speculation.
