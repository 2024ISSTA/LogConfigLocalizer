yarn.dispatcher.drain-events.timeout,300000,1-INFO	DefaultSpeculator.addSpeculativeAttempt -- we are speculating task_1701359859177_0294_r_000008,"This configuration option is related to the timeout of event processing in YARN, which is a part of the Hadoop system that manages resources and scheduling for computational tasks. The log message indicates that a speculative task is being added, which could be related to the event processing in YARN. However, the description of this configuration option is missing, which might cause errors or unexpected behavior."
mapreduce.task.exit.timeout.check-interval-ms,20000,1-INFO	DefaultSpeculator.addSpeculativeAttempt -- we are speculating task_1701359859177_0294_r_000008,"This configuration option is related to the interval at which the MapReduce framework checks if task attempts stay in finishing state for too long. The log message indicates that a speculative task is being added, which could be related to the task execution in MapReduce. If the check interval is too long, it might cause delays or inefficiencies in task execution."
yarn.app.mapreduce.client.max-retries,3,1-INFO	DefaultSpeculator.addSpeculativeAttempt -- we are speculating task_1701359859177_0294_r_000008,"This configuration option is related to the number of client retries to the ResourceManager/HistoryServer before throwing an exception. The log message indicates that a speculative task is being added, which could be related to the client-server communication in MapReduce. If the number of retries is too low, it might cause premature failures in task execution."
