yarn.nodemanager.localizer.cache.target-size-mb,10240,1-INFO	DefaultSpeculator.addSpeculativeAttempt -- we are speculating task_1701359859177_0180_r_000008,"The log indicates that a task is being speculated, which could be due to insufficient cache size. The configuration option 'yarn.nodemanager.localizer.cache.target-size-mb' is relevant here as it sets the target size for the localizer cache. The value is currently set to 10240 MB, which might not be enough for the tasks to run efficiently, leading to speculation."
mapreduce.shuffle.connection-keep-alive.timeout,5,1-INFO	DefaultSpeculator.addSpeculativeAttempt -- we are speculating task_1701359859177_0180_r_000008,"The log indicates that a task is being speculated, which could be due to connection issues during the shuffle phase. The configuration option 'mapreduce.shuffle.connection-keep-alive.timeout' is relevant here as it sets the timeout for keeping the shuffle connection alive. The value is currently set to 5 seconds, which might be too short, leading to premature connection termination and task speculation."
fs.s3a.attempts.maximum,20,1-INFO	DefaultSpeculator.addSpeculativeAttempt -- we are speculating task_1701359859177_0180_r_000008,"The log indicates that a task is being speculated, which could be due to transient errors during S3A operations. The configuration option 'fs.s3a.attempts.maximum' is relevant here as it sets the maximum number of retry attempts for S3A commands. The value is currently set to 20, which might be too low, leading to task speculation when the maximum number of attempts is reached."
