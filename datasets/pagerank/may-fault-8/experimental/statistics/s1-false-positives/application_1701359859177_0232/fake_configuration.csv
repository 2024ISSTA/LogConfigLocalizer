3,dfs.client.block.write.locateFollowingBlock.initial.delay.ms,400,"The initial delay (unit is ms) for locateFollowingBlock,
    the delay time will increase exponentially(double) for each retry
    until dfs.client.block.write.locateFollowingBlock.max.delay.ms is reached,
    after that the delay for each retry will be
    dfs.client.block.write.locateFollowingBlock.max.delay.ms."

    operations. If the LDAP provider doesn't establish a connection within the
    specified period, it will abort the connect attempt. Non-positive value
    means no LDAP connection timeout is specified in which case it waits for the
    connection to establish until the underlying network times out."
