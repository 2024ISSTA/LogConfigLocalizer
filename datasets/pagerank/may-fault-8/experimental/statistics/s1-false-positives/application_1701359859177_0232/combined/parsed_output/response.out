name:mapreduce.reduce.cpu.vcores
value:0
relevant log:1-INFO	DefaultSpeculator.addSpeculativeAttempt -- we are speculating task_1701359859177_0233_r_000009
explanation:The number of virtual cores for each reduce task is set to 0, which might cause the task speculation as the task might not have enough resources to run.

value:3
relevant log:1-INFO	DefaultSpeculator.addSpeculativeAttempt -- we are speculating task_1701359859177_0233_r_000009
explanation:The maximum failures allowed when trying to get block information from a specific datanode is set to 3. If the task fails to get block information more than 3 times, it might cause the task speculation.

value:400
relevant log:1-INFO	DefaultSpeculator.addSpeculativeAttempt -- we are speculating task_1701359859177_0233_r_000009
explanation:The initial delay for locateFollowingBlock is set to 400ms. If the task takes longer than this to locate the following block, it might cause the task speculation.
