io.bytes.per.checksum,<missing>,1-DefaultSpeculator.addSpeculativeAttempt -- we are speculating task_1701359859177_0149_m_000010,The configuration for the number of bytes per checksum is missing. This could cause issues with data integrity checks during task execution.
yarn.sharedcache.cleaner.resource-sleep-ms,0,1-DefaultSpeculator.addSpeculativeAttempt -- we are speculating task_1701359859177_0149_m_000010,"The value for the yarn.sharedcache.cleaner.resource-sleep-ms is set to 0. This could cause the cleaner to continuously run without any sleep, potentially causing resource exhaustion."
dfs.namenode.snapshot.skiplist.max.levels,0,1-DefaultSpeculator.addSpeculativeAttempt -- we are speculating task_1701359859177_0149_m_000010,"The dfs.namenode.snapshot.skiplist.max.levels is set to 0. This means a linear list will be used to store the directory snapshot diffs, which could potentially cause performance issues."
