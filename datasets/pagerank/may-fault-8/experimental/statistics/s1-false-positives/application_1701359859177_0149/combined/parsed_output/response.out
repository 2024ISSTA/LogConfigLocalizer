name:dfs.namenode.snapshot.skiplist.max.levels
value:0
relevant log:1-DefaultSpeculator.addSpeculativeAttempt -- we are speculating task_1701359859177_0149_m_000010
explanation:The dfs.namenode.snapshot.skiplist.max.levels is set to 0. This means a linear list will be used to store the directory snapshot diffs, which could potentially cause performance issues.
