0,io.bytes.per.checksum,,"The number of bytes per checksum.  Must not be larger than
  io.file.buffer.size."
1,dfs.content-summary.limit,5000,"The maximum content summary counts allowed in one locking period. 0 or a negative number
    means no limit (i.e. no yielding)."
2,ipc.[port_number].decay-scheduler.metrics.top.user.count,10,"The number of top (i.e., heaviest) users to emit metric
    information about. This property applies to DecayRpcScheduler."
3,dfs.client.deadnode.detection.probe.suspectnode.threads,10,The maximum number of threads to use for probing suspect node.
4,dfs.namenode.max-corrupt-file-blocks-returned,100,"The maximum number of corrupt file blocks listed by NameNode Web UI,
      JMX and other client request."
5,fs.s3a.retry.limit,7,"Number of times to retry any repeatable S3 client request on failure,
    excluding throttling requests."
6,dfs.datanode.balance.max.concurrent.moves,100,"Maximum number of threads for Datanode balancer pending moves.  This
    value is reconfigurable via the ""dfsadmin -reconfig"" command."
7,dfs.client.mmap.cache.size,256,"When zero-copy reads are used, the DFSClient keeps a cache of recently used
    memory mapped regions.  This parameter controls the maximum number of
    entries that we will keep in that cache.

    The larger this number is, the more file descriptors we will potentially
    use for memory-mapped files.  mmaped files also use virtual address space.
    You may need to increase your ulimit virtual address space limits before
    increasing the client mmap cache size.

    Note that you can still do zero-copy reads when this size is set to 0."
8,dfs.namenode.file.close.num-committed-allowed,0,"Normally a file can only be closed with all its blocks are committed.
    When this value is set to a positive integer N, a file can be closed
    when N blocks are committed and the rest complete."
9,dfs.namenode.replication.max-streams-hard-limit,4,Hard limit for all replication streams.
