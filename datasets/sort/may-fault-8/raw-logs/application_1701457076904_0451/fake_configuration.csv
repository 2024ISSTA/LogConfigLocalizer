0,mapreduce.reduce.shuffle.retry-delay.max.ms,0,"The maximum number of ms the reducer will delay before retrying
  to download map data."
1,fs.trash.checkpoint.interval,0,"Number of minutes between trash checkpoints.
  Should be smaller or equal to fs.trash.interval. If zero,
  the value is set to the value of fs.trash.interval.
  Every time the checkpointer runs it creates a new checkpoint
  out of current and removes checkpoints created more than
  fs.trash.interval minutes ago."
2,dfs.client.cached.conn.retry,3,"The number of times the HDFS client will pull a socket from the
   cache.  Once this number is exceeded, the client will try to create a new
   socket."
3,dfs.client.deadnode.detection.probe.suspectnode.threads,10,The maximum number of threads to use for probing suspect node.
4,ha.failover-controller.graceful-fence.connection.retries,1,FC connection retries for graceful fencing
5,dfs.client.block.write.retries,3,"The number of retries for writing blocks to the data nodes, 
  before we signal failure to the application."
