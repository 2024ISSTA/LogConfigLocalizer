0,dfs.ls.limit,0.93906856,"Limit the number of files printed by ls. If less or equal to
    zero, at most DFS_LIST_LIMIT_DEFAULT (= 1000) will be printed."
1,ha.failover-controller.active-standby-elector.zk.op.retries,3,The number of zookeeper operation retry times in ActiveStandbyElector
2,yarn.app.mapreduce.client.job.max-retries,3,"The number of retries the client will make for getJob and
    dependent calls.
    This is needed for non-HDFS DFS where additional, high level
    retries are required to avoid spurious failures during the getJob call.
    30 is a good value for WASB"
3,mapreduce.reduce.shuffle.parallelcopies,5,"The default number of parallel transfers run by reduce
  during the copy(shuffle) phase."
4,yarn.resourcemanager.rm.container-allocation.expiry-interval-ms,600000,
5,dfs.client.test.drop.namenode.response.number,0,"The number of Namenode responses dropped by DFSClient for each RPC call.  Used
    for testing the NN retry cache."
6,dfs.datanode.slowdisk.low.threshold.ms,20,Threshold in milliseconds below which a disk is definitely not slow.
7,dfs.heartbeat.interval,3,"Determines datanode heartbeat interval in seconds.
    Can use the following suffix (case insensitive):
    ms(millis), s(sec), m(min), h(hour), d(day)
    to specify the time (such as 2s, 2m, 1h, etc.).
    Or provide complete number in seconds (such as 30 for 30 seconds).
    If no time unit is specified then seconds is assumed."
8,mapreduce.task.exit.timeout,60000,"The number of milliseconds before a task will be
  terminated if it stays in finishing state for too long.
  After a task attempt completes from TaskUmbilicalProtocol's point of view,
  it will be transitioned to finishing state. That will give a chance for the
  task to exit by itself."
9,ipc.[port_number].weighted-cost.response,1,"The weight multiplier to apply to the time spent in the
    RESPONSE phase which do not involve holding a lock.
    See org.apache.hadoop.ipc.ProcessingDetails.Timing for more details on
    this phase. This property applies to WeightedTimeCostProvider."
