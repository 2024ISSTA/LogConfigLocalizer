0,ipc.[port_number].decay-scheduler.period-ms,XAZnF,"How frequently the decay factor should be applied to the
    operation counts of users. Higher values have less overhead, but respond
    less quickly to changes in client behavior.
    This property applies to DecayRpcScheduler."
1,mapreduce.task.stuck.timeout-ms,600000,"The max timeout before receiving remote task's first heartbeat.
    This parameter is in order to avoid waiting for the container
    to start indefinitely, which made task stuck in the NEW state.
    A value of 0 disables the timeout."

4,dfs.client.write.exclude.nodes.cache.expiry.interval.millis,600000,"The maximum period to keep a DN in the excluded nodes list
  at a client. After this period, in milliseconds, the previously excluded node(s) will
  be removed automatically from the cache and will be considered good for block allocations
  again. Useful to lower or raise in situations where you keep a file open for very long
  periods (such as a Write-Ahead-Log (WAL) file) to make the writer tolerant to cluster maintenance
  restarts. Defaults to 10 minutes."

6,dfs.ha.zkfc.nn.http.timeout.ms,20000,"The HTTP connection and read timeout value (unit is ms ) when DFS ZKFC
    tries to get local NN thread dump after local NN becomes
    SERVICE_NOT_RESPONDING or SERVICE_UNHEALTHY.
    If it is set to zero, DFS ZKFC won't get local NN thread dump."
7,hadoop.security.kms.client.failover.sleep.max.millis,2000,"Expert only. The time to wait, in milliseconds, between failover
    attempts increases exponentially as a function of the number of
    attempts made so far, with a random factor of +/- 50%. This option
    specifies the maximum value to wait between failovers.
    Specifically, the time between two failover attempts will not
    exceed +/- 50% of hadoop.security.client.failover.sleep.max.millis
    milliseconds."
