2,hadoop.fuse.connection.timeout,300,"The minimum number of seconds that we'll cache libhdfs connection objects
    in fuse_dfs. Lower values will result in lower memory consumption; higher
    values may speed up access by avoiding the overhead of creating new
    connection objects."
3,mapreduce.job.local-fs.single-disk-limit.check.interval-ms,5000,Interval of disk limit check to run in ms.
4,dfs.namenode.handler.count,10,"The number of Namenode RPC server threads that listen to
  requests from clients.
  If dfs.namenode.servicerpc-address is not configured then
  Namenode RPC server threads listen to requests from all nodes."
5,ha.failover-controller.cli-check.rpc-timeout.ms,20000,"Timeout that the CLI (manual) FC waits for monitorHealth, getServiceState"
6,mapreduce.shuffle.pathcache.concurrency-level,16,"Uses the concurrency level to create a fixed number of hashtable
    segments, each governed by its own write lock."

    the highest number of votes from peers."
8,hadoop.security.key.default.bitlength,128,"The length (bits) of keys we want the KeyProvider to produce. Key length
    defines the upper-bound on an algorithm's security, ideally, it would
    coincide with the lower-bound on an algorithm's security."
9,dfs.journalnode.edit-cache-size.bytes,1048576,"The size, in bytes, of the in-memory cache of edits to keep on the
    JournalNode. This cache is used to serve edits for tailing via the RPC-based
    mechanism, and is only enabled when dfs.ha.tail-edits.in-progress is true.
    Transactions range in size but are around 200 bytes on average, so the
    default of 1MB can store around 5000 transactions."
