0,dfs.datanode.ec.reconstruction.stripedread.timeout.millis,0,Datanode striped read timeout in milliseconds.
1,hadoop.http.cross-origin.max-age,1800,"The number of seconds a pre-flighted request can be cached
    for web services needing cross-origin (CORS) support."
2,hadoop.security.crypto.buffer.size,8192,The buffer size used by CryptoInputStream and CryptoOutputStream.
3,ipc.server.max.connections,0,"The maximum number of concurrent connections a server is allowed
    to accept. If this limit is exceeded, incoming connections will first fill
    the listen queue and then may go to an OS-specific listen overflow queue.
    The client may fail or timeout, but the server can avoid running out of file
    descriptors using this feature. 0 means no limit."
4,dfs.edit.log.transfer.bandwidthPerSec,0,"Maximum bandwidth used for transferring edit log to between journal nodes
    for syncing, in bytes per second.
    A default value of 0 indicates that throttling is disabled."
5,dfs.client.failover.connection.retries.on.timeouts,0,"Expert only. The number of retry attempts a failover IPC client
    will make on socket timeout when establishing a server connection."
6,dfs.datanode.directoryscan.throttle.limit.ms.per.sec,1000,"The report compilation threads are limited to only running for
  a given number of milliseconds per second, as configured by the
  property. The limit is taken per thread, not in aggregate, e.g. setting
  a limit of 100ms for 4 compiler threads will result in each thread being
  limited to 100ms, not 25ms.

  Note that the throttle does not interrupt the report compiler threads, so the
  actual running time of the threads per second will typically be somewhat
  higher than the throttle limit, usually by no more than 20%.

  Setting this limit to 1000 disables compiler thread throttling. Only
  values between 1 and 1000 are valid. Setting an invalid value will result
  in the throttle being disabled and an error message being logged. 1000 is
  the default setting."
7,hadoop.hdfs.configuration.version,1,version of this configuration file
8,dfs.client.socket-timeout,60000,Default timeout value in milliseconds for all sockets.
