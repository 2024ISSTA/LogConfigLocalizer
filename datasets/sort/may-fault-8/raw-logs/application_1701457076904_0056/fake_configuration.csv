0,dfs.replication.max,-0.33214396,Maximal block replication.
1,tfile.fs.output.buffer.size,262144,Buffer size used for FSDataOutputStream in bytes.
2,yarn.nodemanager.container-retry-minimum-interval-ms,1000,
3,hadoop.security.kms.client.failover.sleep.max.millis,2000,"Expert only. The time to wait, in milliseconds, between failover
    attempts increases exponentially as a function of the number of
    attempts made so far, with a random factor of +/- 50%. This option
    specifies the maximum value to wait between failovers.
    Specifically, the time between two failover attempts will not
    exceed +/- 50% of hadoop.security.client.failover.sleep.max.millis
    milliseconds."

               to establish a server connection."

    reset to zero if there is no increment."
7,dfs.ha.zkfc.nn.http.timeout.ms,20000,"The HTTP connection and read timeout value (unit is ms ) when DFS ZKFC
    tries to get local NN thread dump after local NN becomes
    SERVICE_NOT_RESPONDING or SERVICE_UNHEALTHY.
    If it is set to zero, DFS ZKFC won't get local NN thread dump."

9,ipc.client.rpc-timeout.ms,0,"Timeout on waiting response from server, in milliseconds.
  If ipc.client.ping is set to true and this rpc-timeout is greater than
  the value of ipc.ping.interval, the effective value of the rpc-timeout is
  rounded up to multiple of ipc.ping.interval."
