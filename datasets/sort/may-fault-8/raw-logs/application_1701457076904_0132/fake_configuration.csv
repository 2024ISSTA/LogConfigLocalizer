5,dfs.namenode.decommission.max.concurrent.tracked.nodes,100,"The maximum number of decommission-in-progress or
    entering-maintenance datanodes nodes that will be tracked at one time by
    the namenode. Tracking these datanode consumes additional NN memory
    proportional to the number of blocks on the datnode. Having a conservative
    limit reduces the potential impact of decommissioning or maintenance of
    a large number of nodes at once.
      
    A value of 0 means no limit will be enforced."
