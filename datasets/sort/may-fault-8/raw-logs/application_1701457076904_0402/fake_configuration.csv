0,dfs.datanode.cache.revocation.timeout.ms,-0.7346693,"When the DFSClient reads from a block file which the DataNode is
    caching, the DFSClient can skip verifying checksums.  The DataNode will
    keep the block file in cache until the client is done.  If the client takes
    an unusually long time, though, the DataNode may need to evict the block
    file from the cache anyway.  This value controls how long the DataNode will
    wait for the client to release a replica that it is reading without
    checksums."
1,ipc.client.connect.max.retries,10,"Indicates the number of retries a client will make to establish
               a server connection."
2,dfs.image.parallel.inode.threshold,1000000,"If the image contains less inodes than this setting, then
        do not write sub-sections and hence disable parallel loading.
        This is because small images load very quickly in serial and
        parallel loading is not needed."
3,hadoop.http.idle_timeout.ms,60000,NN/JN/DN Server connection timeout in milliseconds.
4,mapreduce.job.running.reduce.limit,0,"The maximum number of simultaneous reduce tasks per job.
  There is no limit if this value is 0 or negative."
5,dfs.namenode.delegation.token.max-lifetime,604800000,"The maximum lifetime in milliseconds for which a delegation 
      token is valid."
6,mapreduce.map.maxattempts,4,"Expert: The maximum number of attempts per map task.
  In other words, framework will try to execute a map task these many number
  of times before giving up on it."
7,dfs.namenode.edekcacheloader.initial.delay.ms,3000,"When KeyProvider is configured, the time delayed until the first
    attempt to warm up edek cache on NN start up / become active."
8,mapreduce.shuffle.max.connections,0,"Max allowed connections for the shuffle.  Set to 0 (zero)
               to indicate no limit on the number of connections."
9,mapreduce.job.reduces,1,"The default number of reduce tasks per job. Typically set to 99%
  of the cluster's reduce capacity, so that if a node fails the reduces can
  still be executed in a single wave.
  Ignored when mapreduce.framework.name is ""local""."
