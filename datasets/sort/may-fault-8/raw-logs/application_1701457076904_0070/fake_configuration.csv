0,dfs.datanode.ec.reconstruction.threads,0,"Number of threads used by the Datanode for background
    reconstruction work."
1,hadoop.security.group.mapping.ldap.directory.search.timeout,10000,"The attribute applied to the LDAP SearchControl properties to set a
    maximum time limit when searching and awaiting a result.
    Set to 0 if infinite wait period is desired.
    Default is 10 seconds. Units in milliseconds."
2,hadoop.security.groups.cache.background.reload.threads,3,"Only relevant if hadoop.security.groups.cache.background.reload is true.
    Controls the number of concurrent background user->group cache entry
    refreshes. Pending refresh requests beyond this value are queued and
    processed when a thread is free."
3,yarn.resourcemanager.nm-container-queuing.max-queue-length,15,
4,dfs.namenode.max.op.size,52428800,Maximum opcode size in bytes.
5,dfs.datanode.available-space-volume-choosing-policy.balanced-space-threshold,10737418240,"Only used when the dfs.datanode.fsdataset.volume.choosing.policy is set to
    org.apache.hadoop.hdfs.server.datanode.fsdataset.AvailableSpaceVolumeChoosingPolicy.
    This setting controls how much DN volumes are allowed to differ in terms of
    bytes of free disk space before they are considered imbalanced. If the free
    space of all the volumes are within this range of each other, the volumes
    will be considered balanced and block assignments will be done on a pure
    round robin basis. Support multiple size unit suffix(case insensitive), as
    described in dfs.blocksize."
6,dfs.block.invalidate.limit,1000,"The maximum number of invalidate blocks sent by namenode to a datanode
    per heartbeat deletion command. This property works with
    ""dfs.namenode.invalidate.work.pct.per.iteration"" to throttle block
    deletions."
7,ipc.server.max.connections,0,"The maximum number of concurrent connections a server is allowed
    to accept. If this limit is exceeded, incoming connections will first fill
    the listen queue and then may go to an OS-specific listen overflow queue.
    The client may fail or timeout, but the server can avoid running out of file
    descriptors using this feature. 0 means no limit."

9,mapreduce.job.speculative.retry-after-speculate,15000,"The waiting time(ms) to do next round of speculation
  if there are tasks speculated in this round."
