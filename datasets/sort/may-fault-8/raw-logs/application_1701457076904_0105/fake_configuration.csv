2,dfs.disk.balancer.plan.threshold.percent,10,"The percentage threshold value for volume Data Density in a plan.
      If the absolute value of volume Data Density which is out of
      threshold value in a node, it means that the volumes corresponding to
      the disks should do the balancing in the plan. The default value is 10."

    wait before job end notification is retried if it fails. This is capped by

    Can be in octal or in symbolic. Examples are:
    ""022"" (octal for u=rwx,g=r-x,o=r-x in symbolic),
    or ""u=rwx,g=rwx,o="" (symbolic for 007 in octal)."

6,dfs.namenode.redundancy.queue.restart.iterations,2400,"When picking blocks from the low redundancy queues, reset the
    bookmarked iterator after the set number of iterations to ensure any blocks
    which were not processed on the first pass are retried before the iterators
    would naturally reach their end point. This ensures blocks are retried
    more frequently when there are many pending blocks or blocks are
    continuously added to the queues preventing the iterator reaching its
    natural endpoint.
    The default setting of 2400 combined with the default of
    dfs.namenode.redundancy.interval.seconds means the iterators will be reset
    approximately every 2 hours.
    Setting this parameter to zero disables the feature and the iterators will
    be reset only when the end of all queues has been reached."
