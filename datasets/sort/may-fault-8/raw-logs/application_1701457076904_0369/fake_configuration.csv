0,dfs.namenode.resource.checked.volumes.minimum,,The minimum number of redundant NameNode storage volumes required.

2,dfs.namenode.available-space-rack-fault-tolerant-block-placement-policy.balanced-space-tolerance,5,"Only used when the dfs.block.replicator.classname is set to
    org.apache.hadoop.hdfs.server.blockmanagement.AvailableSpaceRackFaultTolerantBlockPlacementPolicy.
    Special value between 0 and 20, inclusive. if the value is set beyond the scope,
    this value will be set as 5 by default, Increases tolerance of
    placing blocks on Datanodes with similar disk space used."
3,dfs.encrypt.data.transfer.cipher.key.bitlength,128,"The key bitlength negotiated by dfsclient and datanode for encryption.
    This value may be set to either 128, 192 or 256."
4,dfs.qjournal.accept-recovery.timeout.ms,120000,"Quorum timeout in milliseconds during accept phase of
    recovery/synchronization for a specific segment."
5,yarn.dispatcher.print-events-info.threshold,5000,
6,dfs.client.failover.sleep.max.millis,15000,"Expert only. The time to wait, in milliseconds, between failover
    attempts increases exponentially as a function of the number of
    attempts made so far, with a random factor of +/- 50%. This option
    specifies the maximum value to wait between failovers. 
    Specifically, the time between two failover attempts will not
    exceed +/- 50% of dfs.client.failover.sleep.max.millis
    milliseconds."
7,yarn.timeline-service.client.drain-entities.timeout.ms,2000,
8,ipc.server.max.connections,0,"The maximum number of concurrent connections a server is allowed
    to accept. If this limit is exceeded, incoming connections will first fill
    the listen queue and then may go to an OS-specific listen overflow queue.
    The client may fail or timeout, but the server can avoid running out of file
    descriptors using this feature. 0 means no limit."
9,dfs.mover.retry.max.attempts,10,"The maximum number of retries before the mover consider the
    move failed."
