  io.file.buffer.size."
1,dfs.client.block.reader.remote.buffer.size,512,"The output stream buffer size of a DFSClient remote read. The buffer default value is 512B. The buffer includes
      only some request parameters that are: block, blockToken, clientName, startOffset, len, verifyChecksum,
      cachingStrategy."
2,fs.s3a.threads.max,64,"The total number of threads available in the filesystem for data
    uploads *or any other queued filesystem operation*."
3,dfs.storage.policy.satisfier.self.retry.timeout.millis,300000,"If any of file related block movements not at all reported by datanode,
    then after this timeout(in milliseconds), the item will be added back to movement needed list
    at namenode which will be retried for block movements.
    The default value is 5 * 60 * 1000 (5 mins)"

    related to decommission and maintenance operations that can be loaded
    into the replication queue at any given time. Every
    dfs.namenode.decommission.interval seconds, the list is checked to see if
    the blocks have become fully replicated and then further blocks are added
    to reach the limit defined in this parameter."

8,dfs.namenode.stale.datanode.minimum.interval,3,"Minimum number of missed heartbeats intervals for a datanode to
    be marked stale by the Namenode.  The actual interval is calculated as
    (dfs.namenode.stale.datanode.minimum.interval * dfs.heartbeat.interval)
    in seconds.  If this value is greater than the property
    dfs.namenode.stale.datanode.interval, then the calculated value above
    is used."
9,dfs.namenode.edits.dir.minimum,1,"dfs.namenode.edits.dir includes both required directories
    (specified by dfs.namenode.edits.dir.required) and optional directories.

    The number of usable optional directories must be greater than or equal
    to this property.  If the number of usable optional directories falls
    below dfs.namenode.edits.dir.minimum, HDFS will issue an error.

    This property defaults to 1."
