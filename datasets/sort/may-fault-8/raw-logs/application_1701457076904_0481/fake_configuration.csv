0,dfs.stream-buffer-size,,"The size of buffer to stream files.
  The size of this buffer should probably be a multiple of hardware
  page size (4096 on Intel x86), and it determines how much data is
  buffered during read and write operations."
1,dfs.client.read.shortcircuit.streams.cache.expiry.ms,300000,"This controls the minimum amount of time
    file descriptors need to sit in the client cache context
    before they can be closed for being inactive for too long."
2,dfs.client.failover.sleep.max.millis,15000,"Expert only. The time to wait, in milliseconds, between failover
    attempts increases exponentially as a function of the number of
    attempts made so far, with a random factor of +/- 50%. This option
    specifies the maximum value to wait between failovers. 
    Specifically, the time between two failover attempts will not
    exceed +/- 50% of dfs.client.failover.sleep.max.millis
    milliseconds."
3,dfs.datanode.ec.reconstruct.read.bandwidthPerSec,0,"Specifies the maximum amount of bandwidth that the EC reconstruction can utilize for reading.
      When the bandwidth value is zero, there is no limit."
4,dfs.namenode.checkpoint.period,3600,"The number of seconds between two periodic checkpoints.
    Support multiple time unit suffix(case insensitive), as described
    in dfs.heartbeat.interval.If no time unit is specified then seconds
    is assumed."
5,ipc.client.idlethreshold,4000,"Defines the threshold number of connections after which
               connections will be inspected for idleness."

7,yarn.nodemanager.localizer.cache.cleanup.interval-ms,600000,
8,dfs.block.scanner.volume.bytes.per.second,1048576,"If this is configured less than or equal to zero, the DataNode's block scanner will be disabled.  If this
        is positive, this is the number of bytes per second that the DataNode's
        block scanner will try to scan from each volume."
9,mapreduce.task.merge.progress.records,10000,"The number of records to process during merge before
   sending a progress notification to the MR ApplicationMaster."
