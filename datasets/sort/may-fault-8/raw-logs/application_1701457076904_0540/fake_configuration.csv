1,dfs.image.parallel.threads,4,"The number of threads to use when dfs.image.parallel.load is
        enabled. This setting should be less than
        dfs.image.parallel.target.sections. The optimal number of
        threads will depend on the hardware and environment."
2,hadoop.security.kms.client.authentication.retry-count,1,Number of time to retry connecting to KMS on authentication failure
3,dfs.mover.movedWinWidth,5400000,"The minimum time interval, in milliseconds, that a block can be
    moved to another location again."

5,dfs.namenode.inotify.max.events.per.rpc,1000,"Maximum number of events that will be sent to an inotify client
    in a single RPC response. The default value attempts to amortize away
    the overhead for this RPC while avoiding huge memory requirements for the
    client and NameNode (1000 events should consume no more than 1 MB.)"

7,dfs.namenode.stale.datanode.minimum.interval,3,"Minimum number of missed heartbeats intervals for a datanode to
    be marked stale by the Namenode.  The actual interval is calculated as
    (dfs.namenode.stale.datanode.minimum.interval * dfs.heartbeat.interval)
    in seconds.  If this value is greater than the property
    dfs.namenode.stale.datanode.interval, then the calculated value above
    is used."
