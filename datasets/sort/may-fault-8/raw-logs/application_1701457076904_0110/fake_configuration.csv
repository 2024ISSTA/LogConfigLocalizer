0,dfs.provided.aliasmap.inmemory.batch-size,0.81260926,The batch size when iterating over the database backing the aliasmap
1,dfs.client.deadnode.detection.probe.deadnode.interval.ms,60000,Interval time in milliseconds for probing dead node behavior.
2,ftp.stream-buffer-size,4096,"The size of buffer to stream files.
  The size of this buffer should probably be a multiple of hardware
  page size (4096 on Intel x86), and it determines how much data is
  buffered during read and write operations."
3,yarn.nodemanager.collector-service.thread-count,5,
4,dfs.image.transfer.chunksize,65536,"Chunksize in bytes to upload the checkpoint.
        Chunked streaming is used to avoid internal buffering of contents
        of image file of huge size.
        Support multiple size unit suffix(case insensitive), as described
        in dfs.blocksize."
5,dfs.namenode.write-lock-reporting-threshold-ms,5000,"When a write lock is held on the namenode for a long time,
    this will be logged as the lock is released. This sets how long the
    lock must be held for logging to occur."
6,dfs.namenode.checkpoint.period,3600,"The number of seconds between two periodic checkpoints.
    Support multiple time unit suffix(case insensitive), as described
    in dfs.heartbeat.interval.If no time unit is specified then seconds
    is assumed."
7,seq.io.sort.mb,100,"The total amount of buffer memory to use while sorting files,
      while using SequenceFile.Sorter, in megabytes. By default,
      gives each merge stream 1MB, which should minimize seeks."
8,fs.s3a.paging.maximum,5000,"How many keys to request from S3 when doing
     directory listings at a time."
9,hadoop.security.crypto.buffer.size,8192,The buffer size used by CryptoInputStream and CryptoOutputStream.
