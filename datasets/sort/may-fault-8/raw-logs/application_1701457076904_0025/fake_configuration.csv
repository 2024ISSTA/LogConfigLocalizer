    operation counts of users. Higher values have less overhead, but respond
    less quickly to changes in client behavior.
    This property applies to DecayRpcScheduler."

    This parameter controls the maximum number of file descriptors in the cache.
    Setting this higher will use more file descriptors,
    but potentially provide better performance on workloads
    involving lots of seeks."

    in a single RPC response. The default value attempts to amortize away
    the overhead for this RPC while avoiding huge memory requirements for the
    client and NameNode (1000 events should consume no more than 1 MB.)"
5,yarn.app.mapreduce.client-am.ipc.max-retries-on-timeouts,3,"The number of client retries on socket timeouts to the AM - before
    reconnecting to the RM to fetch Application Status.
    In other words, it is the ipc.client.connect.max.retries.on.timeouts to be used during
    reconnecting to the RM and fetching Application Status."
6,dfs.ha.log-roll.period,120,"How often, in seconds, the StandbyNode should ask the active to
    roll edit logs. Since the StandbyNode only reads from finalized
    log segments, the StandbyNode will only be as up-to-date as how
    often the logs are rolled. Note that failover triggers a log roll
    so the StandbyNode will be up to date before it becomes active.
    Support multiple time unit suffix(case insensitive), as described
    in dfs.heartbeat.interval.If no time unit is specified then seconds
    is assumed."
