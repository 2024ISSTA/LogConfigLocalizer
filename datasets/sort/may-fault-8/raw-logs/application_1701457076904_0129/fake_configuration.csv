1,ipc.client.rpc-timeout.ms,0,"Timeout on waiting response from server, in milliseconds.
  If ipc.client.ping is set to true and this rpc-timeout is greater than
  the value of ipc.ping.interval, the effective value of the rpc-timeout is
  rounded up to multiple of ipc.ping.interval."
2,dfs.namenode.lazypersist.file.scrub.interval.sec,300,"The NameNode periodically scans the namespace for LazyPersist files with
    missing blocks and unlinks them from the namespace. This configuration key
    controls the interval between successive scans. If this value is set to 0,
    the file scrubber is disabled."
3,dfs.client.short.circuit.replica.stale.threshold.ms,1800000,"The maximum amount of time that we will consider a short-circuit replica to
    be valid, if there is no communication from the DataNode.  After this time
    has elapsed, we will re-fetch the short-circuit replica even if it is in
    the cache."
4,ipc.maximum.response.length,134217728,"This indicates the maximum IPC message length (bytes) that can be
    accepted by the client. Messages larger than this value are rejected
