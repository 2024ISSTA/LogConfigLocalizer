5,dfs.client.mmap.cache.size,256,"When zero-copy reads are used, the DFSClient keeps a cache of recently used
    memory mapped regions.  This parameter controls the maximum number of
    entries that we will keep in that cache.

    The larger this number is, the more file descriptors we will potentially
    use for memory-mapped files.  mmaped files also use virtual address space.
    You may need to increase your ulimit virtual address space limits before
    increasing the client mmap cache size.

    Note that you can still do zero-copy reads when this size is set to 0."
6,dfs.namenode.resource.check.interval,5000,"The interval in milliseconds at which the NameNode resource checker runs.
    The checker calculates the number of the NameNode storage volumes whose
    available spaces are more than dfs.namenode.resource.du.reserved, and
    enters safemode if the number becomes lower than the minimum value
    specified by dfs.namenode.resource.checked.volumes.minimum."
