0,hadoop.security.crypto.buffer.size,,The buffer size used by CryptoInputStream and CryptoOutputStream.
1,dfs.content-summary.sleep-microsec,500,"The length of time in microseconds to put the thread to sleep, between reaquiring the locks
    in content summary computation."
2,yarn.app.mapreduce.am.containerlauncher.threadpool-initial-size,10,"The initial size of thread pool to launch containers in the
    app master."
3,dfs.image.transfer.chunksize,65536,"Chunksize in bytes to upload the checkpoint.
        Chunked streaming is used to avoid internal buffering of contents
        of image file of huge size.
        Support multiple size unit suffix(case insensitive), as described
        in dfs.blocksize."
4,dfs.qjournal.http.read.timeout.ms,60000,"Timeout in milliseconds when reading from a HTTP connection from remote
    journals."
5,fs.s3a.connection.maximum,96,"Controls the maximum number of simultaneous connections to S3.
    This must be bigger than the value of fs.s3a.threads.max so as to stop
    threads being blocked waiting for new HTTPS connections.
    Why not equal? The AWS SDK transfer manager also uses these connections."
6,dfs.datanode.data.transfer.bandwidthPerSec,0,"Specifies the maximum amount of bandwidth that the data transfering can utilize for transfering block when
      BlockConstructionStage is
      PIPELINE_SETUP_CREATE and clientName is empty.
      When the bandwidth value is zero, there is no limit."
7,yarn.resourcemanager.placement-constraints.retry-attempts,3,
8,dfs.client.read.shortcircuit.streams.cache.size,256,"The DFSClient maintains a cache of recently opened file descriptors.
    This parameter controls the maximum number of file descriptors in the cache.
    Setting this higher will use more file descriptors,
    but potentially provide better performance on workloads
    involving lots of seeks."
9,fs.permissions.umask-mode,22,"The umask used when creating files and directories.
    Can be in octal or in symbolic. Examples are:
    ""022"" (octal for u=rwx,g=r-x,o=r-x in symbolic),
    or ""u=rwx,g=rwx,o="" (symbolic for 007 in octal)."
