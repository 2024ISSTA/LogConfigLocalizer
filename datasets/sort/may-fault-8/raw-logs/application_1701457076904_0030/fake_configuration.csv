3,dfs.datanode.metrics.logger.period.seconds,600,"This setting controls how frequently the DataNode logs its metrics. The
    logging configuration must also define one or more appenders for
    DataNodeMetricsLog for the metrics to be logged.
    DataNode metrics logging is disabled if this value is set to zero or
    less than zero."
