1,yarn.router.pipeline.cache-max-size,25,
2,dfs.datanode.lazywriter.interval.sec,60,Interval in seconds for Datanodes for lazy persist writes.
3,dfs.datanode.slowdisk.low.threshold.ms,20,Threshold in milliseconds below which a disk is definitely not slow.
4,nfs.wtmax,1048576,"This is the maximum size in bytes of a WRITE request
    supported by the NFS gateway. If you change this, make sure you
    also update the nfs mount's wsize(add wsize= # of bytes to the 
    mount directive)."
5,hadoop.security.uid.cache.secs,14400,"This is the config controlling the validity of the entries in the cache
        containing the userId to userName and groupId to groupName used by
        NativeIO getFstat()."

8,dfs.datanode.scan.period.hours,504,"If this is positive, the DataNode will not scan any
        individual block more than once in the specified scan period.
        If this is negative, the block scanner is disabled.
        If this is set to zero, then the default value of 504 hours
        or 3 weeks is used. Prior versions of HDFS incorrectly documented
        that setting this key to zero will disable the block scanner."
9,hadoop.fuse.connection.timeout,300,"The minimum number of seconds that we'll cache libhdfs connection objects
    in fuse_dfs. Lower values will result in lower memory consumption; higher
    values may speed up access by avoiding the overhead of creating new
    connection objects."
