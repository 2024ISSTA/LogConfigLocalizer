2,httpfs.buffer.size,4096,The size buffer to be used when creating or opening httpfs filesystem IO stream.
3,ipc.server.max.connections,0,"The maximum number of concurrent connections a server is allowed
    to accept. If this limit is exceeded, incoming connections will first fill
    the listen queue and then may go to an OS-specific listen overflow queue.
    The client may fail or timeout, but the server can avoid running out of file
    descriptors using this feature. 0 means no limit."
4,mapreduce.shuffle.ssl.file.buffer.size,65536,Buffer size for reading spills from file when using SSL.
5,mapreduce.job.reduces,1,"The default number of reduce tasks per job. Typically set to 99%
  of the cluster's reduce capacity, so that if a node fails the reduces can
  still be executed in a single wave.
  Ignored when mapreduce.framework.name is ""local""."
6,dfs.http.client.failover.max.attempts,15,"Specify the max number of failover attempts for WebHDFS client
    in case of network exception."
7,dfs.cachereport.intervalMsec,10000,"Determines cache reporting interval in milliseconds.  After this amount of
    time, the DataNode sends a full report of its cache state to the NameNode.
    The NameNode uses the cache report to update its map of cached blocks to
    DataNode locations.

    This configuration has no effect if in-memory caching has been disabled by
    setting dfs.datanode.max.locked.memory to 0 (which is the default).

    If the native libraries are not available to the DataNode, this
    configuration has no effect."
8,dfs.namenode.write-lock-reporting-threshold-ms,5000,"When a write lock is held on the namenode for a long time,
    this will be logged as the lock is released. This sets how long the
    lock must be held for logging to occur."
9,dfs.namenode.delegation.key.update-interval,86400000,"The update interval for master key for delegation tokens 
       in the namenode in milliseconds."
